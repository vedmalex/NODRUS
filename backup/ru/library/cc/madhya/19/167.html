        This verse is also found in Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s
        <i>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</i>
        (1.1.11). As we can understand from the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (9.34 and 18.65), the Supreme Personality of Godhead wants everyone to
        think of Him always (
        <i>man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ</i>
        )
        <i>.</i>
        Everyone should become His devotee, not the devotee of a demigod.
        Everyone should engage in His devotional service, including
        <i>arcana</i>
        (Deity worship) in the temple.
        <i>Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru.</i>
        Everyone should offer obeisances, from moment to moment, to the Supreme
        Personality of Godhead. These are the desires of the Supreme Lord, and
        one who fulfills His desires favorably is actually a pure devotee. Kṛṣṇa
        wants everyone to surrender unto Him, and devotional service means
        preaching this gospel all over the world. The Lord says openly in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (18.69),
        <i>na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ:</i>
        One who preaches the gospel of the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        for the benefit of all is most dear to Kṛṣṇa. The
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        is spoken by the Lord so that human society can be perfectly organized
        from all angles of vision — politically, socially, economically,
        philosophically and religiously. From any point of view, human society
        can be reformed by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement; therefore one who
        spreads this philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the benefit of all
        conditioned souls in the universe is perfect in pure devotional service.

        The criterion is that a devotee must know what Kṛṣṇa wants him to do.
        This understanding can be achieved through the medium of a spiritual
        master who is a bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī
        advises,
        <i>ādau gurv-āśrayam.</i>
        One who is serious in wanting to render pure devotional service to the
        Lord must take shelter of a spiritual master who comes in the disciplic
        succession from Kṛṣṇa.
        <i>Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ.</i>
        Without accepting a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic
        succession, one cannot find out the real purpose of devotional service.
        Therefore one has to accept the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master
        and agree to be directed by him. The first business of a pure devotee is
        to satisfy his spiritual master, whose only business is to spread Kṛṣṇa
        consciousness. And if one can satisfy the spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa is
        automatically satisfied —
        <i>yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ.</i>
        This is the success of devotional service. This is the meaning of the
        word
        <i>ānukūlyena</i>
        — that is, favorable devotional service to the Lord. A pure devotee has
        no plans other than those for the Lord’s service. He is not interested
        in attaining success in mundane activities. He simply wants success in
        the progress of devotional service. For a devotee, there cannot be
        worship of others or demigod worship. A pure devotee does not engage
        himself in such pseudo devotional service. He is interested only in
        satisfying Kṛṣṇa. If one lives only for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, it
        does not matter whether he belongs to this order of life or that order
        of life. One’s only business should be to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. This process is
        completely manifest in the activities of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness
        movement. It has been actually proved that the entire world can accept
        devotional service without failure. One simply has to follow the
        instructions of the representative of Kṛṣṇa.
