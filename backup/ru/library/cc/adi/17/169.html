        The
        <i>śāstras</i>
        of the
        <i>yavanas,</i>
        or meat-eaters, are not eternal scriptures. They have been fashioned
        recently, and sometimes they contradict one another. The scriptures of
        the
        <i>yavanas</i>
        are three: the Old Testament, the New Testament and the Koran. Their
        compilation has a history; they are not eternal like the Vedic
        knowledge. Therefore although they have their arguments and reasonings,
        they are not very sound and transcendental. As such, modern people
        advanced in science and philosophy deem these scriptures unacceptable.

        Sometimes Christian priests come to us inquiring, “Why are our followers
        neglecting our scriptures and accepting yours?” But when we ask them,
        “Your Bible says, ‘Do not kill.’ Why then are you killing so many
        animals daily?” they cannot answer. Some of them imperfectly answer that
        the animals have no souls. But then we ask them, “How do you know that
        animals have no souls? Animals and children are of the same nature. Does
        this mean that the children of human society also have no souls?”
        According to the Vedic scriptures, within the body is the owner of the
        body, the soul. In the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (2.13) it is said:

        “As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to
        youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.
        The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.”

        Because the soul is within the body, the body changes through so many
        forms. There is a soul within the body of every living creature, whether
        animal, tree, bird or human being, and the soul is transmigrating from
        one type of body to another. When the scriptures of the
        <i>yavanas</i>
        — namely the Old Testament, New Testament and Koran — cannot properly
        answer inquisitive followers, naturally those advanced in scientific
        knowledge and philosophy lose faith in such scriptures. The Kazi
        admitted this while talking with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Kazi was a
        very intelligent person. He had full knowledge of his position, as
        stated in the following verse.
