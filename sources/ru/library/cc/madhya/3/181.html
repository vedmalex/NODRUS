        It is a great happiness for a mother if her son does not leave home to
        search out Kṛṣṇa but remains with her. At the same time, if a son does
        not search after Kṛṣṇa but simply remains at home, he is certainly
        blamed by experienced saintly persons. Such blame certainly causes great
        unhappiness for a mother. If a real mother wants her son to progress
        spiritually, she had better allow him to go out searching for Kṛṣṇa. The
        mother naturally desires the welfare of the son. If a mother does not
        allow her son to search for Kṛṣṇa, she is called
        <i>mā</i>,
        which indicates
        <i>māyā</i>.
        By allowing her son to go as a
        <i>sannyāsī</i>
        and search for Kṛṣṇa, Śacīmātā instructs all mothers of the world. She
        indicates that all sons should become real devotees of Kṛṣṇa and should
        not stay at home under the care of an affectionate mother. This is
        supported by
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        (5.5.18):

        “No one should become a spiritual master — nor a relative, father,
        mother, worshipable Deity or husband — if he cannot help a person escape
        the imminent path of death.” Every living entity is wandering within the
        universe, subjected to the law of
        <i>karma</i>
        and transmigrating from one body to another and from one planet to
        another. Therefore the whole Vedic process is meant to save the
        wandering living entities from the clutches of
        <i>māyā</i>
        — birth, death, disease and old age. This means stopping the cycle of
        birth and death. This cycle can be stopped only if one worships Kṛṣṇa.
        As the Lord says in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (4.9):

        “One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities
        does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material
        world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.”

        To stop the cycle of birth and death, one has to understand Kṛṣṇa as He
        is. Simply by knowing Kṛṣṇa, one can stop the process of rebirth into
        this material world. By acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can return to
        Godhead. The highest perfection of life is for a father, mother,
        spiritual master, husband or any other family member to help others
        return home, back to Godhead. That is the most preferred welfare
        activity for the benefit of relatives. Therefore, Śacīmātā, although the
        mother of Nimāi Paṇḍita, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, considered all the
        facts and decided to allow her son to go out and search for Kṛṣṇa. At
        the same time, she made some arrangements in order that she might get
        news of all the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
