        In connection with this verse, which is a quotation from
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        (11.23.57), Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that of the
        sixty-four items required for rendering devotional service, acceptance
        of the symbolic marks of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        is a regulative principle. If one accepts the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        order, his main business is to devote his life completely to the service
        of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa. If one does not completely devote his mind and body
        to the service of the Lord, he does not actually become a
        <i>sannyāsī</i>.
        It is not simply a matter of changing dress. In
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (6.1) it is also stated,
        <i>
          anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ/ sa sannyāsī ca yogī
          ca:
        </i>
        one who works devotedly for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa is a
        <i>sannyāsī</i>.
        The dress is not
        <i>sannyāsa</i>,
        but the attitude of service to Kṛṣṇa is.

    <div id="bb1090289" class="r r-lang-ru r-paragraph">

        The word
        <i>parātma-niṣṭhā</i>
        means being a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
        <i>Parātmā</i>,
        the Supreme Person, is Kṛṣṇa.
        <i>Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</i>.
        Those who are completely dedicated to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa in service
        are actually
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>.
        As a matter of formality, the devotee accepts the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        dress as previous
        <i>ācāryas</i>
        did. He also accepts the three
        <i>daṇḍas</i>.
        Later Viṣṇu Svāmī considered that accepting the dress of a
        <i>tri-daṇḍī</i>
        was
        <i>parātma-niṣṭhā</i>.
        Therefore sincere devotees add another
        <i>daṇḍa</i>,
        the
        <i>jīva-daṇḍa</i>,
        to the three existing
        <i>daṇḍas</i>.
        The Vaiṣṇava
        <i>sannyāsī</i>
        is known as a
        <i>tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī</i>.
        The Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsī</i>
        accepts only one
        <i>daṇḍa</i>,
        not understanding the meaning of
        <i>tri-daṇḍa</i>.
        Later, many persons in the community of Śiva Svāmī gave up the
        <i>ātma-niṣṭhā</i>
        (devotional service) of the Lord and followed the path of Śaṅkarācārya.
        Instead of accepting 108 names, those in the Śiva Svāmī
        <i>sampradāya</i>
        follow the path of Śaṅkarācārya and accept the ten names of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>.
        Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the then-existing order of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        (namely
        <i>eka-daṇḍa</i>
        ), He still recited a verse from
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        about the
        <i>tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i>
        accepted by the
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        of Avantīpura. Indirectly He declared that within that
        <i>eka-daṇḍa</i>,
        one
        <i>daṇḍa</i>,
        four
        <i>daṇḍas</i>
        existed as one. Accepting
        <i>ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i>
        without
        <i>parātma-niṣṭhā</i>
        (devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa) is not acceptable to Śrī Caitanya
        Mahāprabhu. In addition, according to the exact regulative principles,
        one should add the
        <i>jīva-daṇḍa</i>
        to the
        <i>tri-daṇḍa</i>.
        These four
        <i>daṇḍas</i>,
        bound together as one, are symbolic of unalloyed devotional service to
        the Lord. Because the
        <i>ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsīs</i>
        of the Māyāvāda school are not devoted to the service of Kṛṣṇa, they try
        to merge into the Brahman effulgence, which is a marginal position
        between material and spiritual existence. They accept this impersonal
        position as liberation. Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>,
        not knowing that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a
        <i>tridaṇḍī</i>,
        think of Caitanya Mahāprabhu as an
        <i>ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsī</i>.
        This is due to their
        <i>vivarta</i>,
        bewilderment. In
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        there is no such thing as an
        <i>ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsī</i>;
        indeed, the
        <i>tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī</i>
        is accepted as the symbolic representation of the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        order. By citing this verse from
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>,
        Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        order recommended in
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>.
        The Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>,
        who are enamored of the external energy of the Lord, cannot understand
        the mind of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

        To date, all the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, following in His
        footsteps, accept the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        order and keep the sacred thread and tuft of unshaved hair. The
        <i>ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsīs</i>
        of the Māyāvādī school give up the sacred thread and do not keep any
        tuft of hair. Therefore they are unable to understand the purport of
        <i>tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i>,
        and as such they are not inclined to dedicate their lives to the service
        of Mukunda. They simply think of merging into the existence of Brahman
        because of their disgust with material existence. The
        <i>ācāryas</i>
        who advocate the
        <i>daiva-varṇāśrama</i>
        (the social order of
        <i>cātur-varṇyam</i>
        mentioned in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        ) do not accept the proposition of
        <i>āsura-varṇāśrama</i>,
        which maintains that the social order of
        <i>varṇa</i>
        is indicated by birth.

        The most intimate devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, namely Gadādhara
        Paṇḍita, accepted
        <i>tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i>
        and also accepted Mādhava Upādhyāya as his
        <i>tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī</i>
        disciple. It is said that from this Mādhavācārya the
        <i>sampradāya</i>
        known in western India as the Vallabhācārya
        <i>sampradāya</i>
        has begun. Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, who is known as a
        <i>smṛty-ācārya</i>
        in the Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇava-sampradāya, later accepted the
        <i>tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i>
        order from Tridaṇḍipāda Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī. Although acceptance of
        <i>tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i>
        is not distinctly mentioned in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava literature, the
        first verse of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s
        <i>Upadeśāmṛta</i>
        advocates that one should accept the
        <i>tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i>
        order by controlling the six forces:

        “One who can control the forces of speech, mind, anger, belly, tongue
        and genitals is known as a
        <i>gosvāmī</i>
        and is competent to accept disciples all over the world.” The followers
        of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never accepted the Māyāvāda order of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>,
        and for this they cannot be blamed. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted
        Śrīdhara Svāmī, who was a
        <i>tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī</i>,
        but the Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>,
        not understanding Śrīdhara Svāmī, sometimes think that Śrīdhara Svāmī
        belonged to the Māyāvāda
        <i>ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa</i>
        community. Actually this was not the case.
