        Śrīla Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya
        Mahāprabhu; therefore when he heard that from Kuliyā Śrī Caitanya
        Mahāprabhu was going to Vṛndāvana, although he had no material wealth he
        began to construct within his mind a very attractive path or road for
        Caitanya Mahāprabhu to traverse. Some of the description of this path is
        given above. But even mentally he could not construct the road beyond
        Kānāi Nāṭaśālā. Therefore he concluded that Caitanya Mahāprabhu would
        not go to Vṛndāvana at that time.

        For a pure devotee, it is the same whether he materially constructs a
        path or constructs one within his mind. This is because the Supreme
        Personality of Godhead, Janārdana, is
        <i>bhāva-grāhī</i>
        , or appreciative of the sentiment. For Him a path made with actual
        jewels and a path made of mental jewels are the same. Though subtle,
        mind is also matter, so any path — indeed, anything for the service of
        the Lord, whether in gross matter or in subtle matter — is accepted
        equally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord accepts the
        attitude of His devotee and sees how much he is prepared to serve Him.
        The devotee is at liberty to serve the Lord either in gross matter or in
        subtle matter. The important point is that the service be in relation
        with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (9.26):

        “If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or
        water, I will accept it.” The real ingredient is
        <i>bhakti</i>
        (devotion). Pure devotion is uncontaminated by the modes of material
        nature.
        <i>Ahaituky apratihatā</i>
        : unconditional devotional service cannot be checked by any material
        condition. This means that one does not have to be very rich to serve
        the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the poorest man can equally
        serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he has pure devotion. If
        there is no ulterior motive, devotional service cannot be checked by any
        material condition.
