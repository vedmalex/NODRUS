        Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī has given a description of these books.
        The
        <i>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</i>
        is a great book of instruction on how to develop devotional service to
        Lord Kṛṣṇa and follow the transcendental process. It was finished in the
        year 1463 Śakābda (A.D. 1541). This book is divided into four parts:
        <i>pūrva-vibhāga</i>
        (eastern division),
        <i>dakṣiṇa-vibhāga</i>
        (southern division),
        <i>paścima-vibhāga</i>
        (western division) and
        <i>uttara-vibhāga</i>
        (northern division). In the
        <i>pūrva-vibhāga</i>
        , there is a description of the permanent development of devotional
        service. The general principles of devotional service, the execution of
        devotional service, ecstasy in devotional service and ultimately the
        attainment of love of Godhead are described. In this way there are four
        <i>laharīs</i>
        (waves) in this division of the ocean of the nectar of devotion.

        In the
        <i>dakṣiṇa-vibhāga</i>
        (southern division) there is a general description of the mellow
        (relationship) called
        <i>bhakti-rasa</i>
        , which is derived from devotional service. There are also descriptions
        of the stages known as
        <i>vibhāva, anubhāva, sāttvika, vyabhicārī</i>
        and
        <i>sthāyi-bhāva</i>
        , all on this high platform of devotional service. Thus there are five
        waves in the
        <i>dakṣiṇa-vibhāga</i>
        division. In the western division (
        <i>paścima-vibhāga</i>
        ) there is a description of the chief transcendental humors derived from
        devotional service. These are known as
        <i>mukhya-bhakti-rasa-nirūpaṇa</i>
        , or attainment of the chief humors or feelings in the execution of
        devotional service. In that part there is a description of devotional
        service in neutrality, further development in love and affection (called
        servitude), further development in fraternity, further development in
        parenthood, or parental love, and finally conjugal love between Kṛṣṇa
        and His devotees. Thus there are five waves in the western division.

        In the northern division (
        <i>uttara-vibhāga</i>
        ) there is a description of the indirect mellows of devotional service —
        namely, devotional service in laughter, devotional service in wonder,
        and devotional service in chivalry, pity, anger, dread and ghastliness.
        There are also mixing of mellows and the transgression of different
        humors. Thus there are nine waves in this part. This is but a brief
        outline of the
        <i>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</i>
        .

        The
        <i>Vidagdha-mādhava</i>
        is a drama of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes in Vṛndāvana. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī
        finished this book in the year 1454 Śakābda (A.D. 1532). The first part
        of this drama is called
        <i>veṇu-nāda-vilāsa</i>
        , the second part
        <i>manmatha-lekha</i>
        , the third part
        <i>rādhā-saṅga</i>
        , the fourth part
        <i>veṇu-haraṇa</i>
        , the fifth part
        <i>rādhā-prasādana</i>
        , the sixth part
        <i>śarad-vihāra</i>
        , and the seventh and last part
        <i>gaurī-vihāra</i>

        There is also a book called
        <i>Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi</i>
        , a transcendental account of loving affairs that includes metaphor,
        analogy and higher
        <i>bhakti</i>
        sentiments. Devotional service in conjugal love is described briefly in
        the
        <i>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</i>
        , but it is very elaborately discussed in the
        <i>Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi</i>
        . This book describes different types of lovers, their assistants, and
        those who are very dear to Kṛṣṇa. There is also a description of Śrīmatī
        Rādhārāṇī and other female lovers, as well as various group leaders.
        Messengers and the constant associates, as well as others who are very
        dear to Kṛṣṇa, are all described. The book also relates how love of
        Kṛṣṇa is awakened and describes the ecstatic situation, the devotional
        situation, permanent ecstasy, disturbed ecstasy, steady ecstasy,
        different positions of different dresses, feelings of separation, prior
        attraction, anger in attraction, varieties of loving affairs, separation
        from the beloved, meeting with the beloved, and both direct and indirect
        enjoyment between the lover and the beloved. All this has been very
        elaborately described.

        Similarly, the
        <i>Lalita-mādhava</i>
        is a description of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes in Dvārakā. These pastimes were
        made into a drama, and the work was finished in the year 1459 Śakābda.
        The first part deals with festivities in the evening, the second with
        the killing of the Śaṅkhacūḍa, the third with maddened Śrīmatī
        Rādhārāṇī, the fourth with Rādhārāṇī’s proceeding toward Kṛṣṇa, the
        fifth with the achievement of Candrāvalī, the sixth with the achievement
        of Lalitā, the seventh with the meeting in Nava-vṛndāvana, the eighth
        with the enjoyment in Nava-vṛndāvana, the ninth with looking over
        pictures, and the tenth with complete satisfaction of the mind. Thus the
        entire drama is divided into ten parts.

        The
        <i>Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta</i>
        is divided into two parts. The first is called “The Nectar of Kṛṣṇa” and
        the second “The Nectar of Devotional Service.” The importance of Vedic
        evidence is stressed in the first part, and this is followed by a
        description of the original form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
        as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and descriptions of His pastimes and expansions in
        <i>svāṁśa</i>
        (personal forms) and
        <i>vibhinnāṁśa</i>
        . According to different absorptions, the incarnations are called
        <i>āveśa</i>
        and
        <i>tad-ekātma</i>
        . The first incarnation is divided into three
        <i>puruṣāvatāras</i>
        — namely, Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Then
        there are the three incarnations of the modes of nature — namely,
        Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara (Śiva). All the paraphernalia used in the
        service of the Lord is transcendental, beyond the three qualities of
        this material world. There is also a description of twenty-five
        <i>līlā-avatāras</i>
        , namely Catuḥsana (the Kumāras), Nārada, Varāha, Matsya, Yajña,
        Nara-nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi, Kapila, Dattātreya, Hayagrīva, Haṁsa, Pṛśnigarbha,
        Ṛṣabha, Pṛthu, Nṛsiṁha, Kūrma, Dhanvantari, Mohinī, Vāmana, Paraśurāma,
        Dāśarathi, Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana, Balarāma, Vāsudeva, Buddha and Kalki. There
        are also fourteen
        <i>manvantara</i>
        incarnations: Yajña, Vibhu, Satyasena, Hari, Vaikuṇṭha, Ajita, Vāmana,
        Sārvabhauma, Ṛṣabha, Viṣvaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudhāmā, Yogeśvara and
        Bṛhadbhānu. There are also four incarnations for the four
        <i>yugas</i>
        , and their colors are described as white, red, blackish and black
        (sometimes yellow, as in the case of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu). There
        are different types of millenniums and incarnations for those
        millenniums. The categories called
        <i>āveśa, prābhava, vaibhava</i>
        and
        <i>para</i>
        constitute different situations for the different incarnations.
        According to specific pastimes, the names are spiritually empowered.
        There are also descriptions of the difference between the powerful and
        the power, and the inconceivable activities of the Supreme Lord.

        Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one is
        greater than Him. He is the source of all incarnations. In the
        <i>Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta</i>
        there are descriptions of His partial incarnations, a description of the
        impersonal Brahman effulgence (actually the bodily effulgence of Śrī
        Kṛṣṇa), the superexcellence of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes as an ordinary human
        being with two hands and so forth. There is nothing to compare with the
        two-armed form of the Lord. In the spiritual world (
        <i>vaikuṇṭha-jagat</i>
        ) there is no distinction between the owner of the body and the body
        itself. In the material world the owner of the body is called the soul,
        and the body is called a material manifestation. In the Vaikuṇṭha world,
        however, there is no such distinction. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is unborn, and His
        appearance as an incarnation is perpetual. Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes are divided
        into two parts — manifest and unmanifest. For example, when Kṛṣṇa takes
        His birth within this material world, His pastimes are considered to be
        manifest. However, when He disappears, one should not think that He is
        finished, for His pastimes are going on in an unmanifest form. Varieties
        of humors, however, are enjoyed by the devotees and Lord Kṛṣṇa during
        His manifest pastimes. After all, His pastimes in Mathurā, Vṛndāvana and
        Dvārakā are eternal and are going on perpetually somewhere in some part
        of the universe.
