      <p>
        Clearly these statements are a real account of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s
        acceptance of the renounced order of life. His acceptance of this
        renounced order is not at all comparable to the acceptance of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        by Māyāvādīs. After accepting
        <i>sannyāsa</i>,
        Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to reach Vṛndāvana. He was unlike the
        Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>,
        who desire to merge into the existence of the Absolute. For a Vaiṣṇava,
        acceptance of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        means getting relief from all material activities and completely
        devoting oneself to the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This
        is confirmed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī (B.r.s. 1.2.255):
        <i>
          anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ/ nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe
          yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.
        </i>
        For a Vaiṣṇava, the renounced order means completely giving up
        attachment for material things and engaging nonstop in the
        transcendental loving service of the Lord. The Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>,
        however, do not know how to engage everything in the service of the
        Lord. Because they have no devotional training, they think material
        objects to be untouchable.
        <i>Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā</i>:
        The Māyāvādīs think that the world is false, but the Vaiṣṇava
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>
        do not think like this. Vaiṣṇavas say, “Why should the world be false?
        It is reality, and it is meant for the service of the Supreme
        Personality of Godhead.” For a Vaiṣṇava
        <i>sannyāsī</i>,
        renunciation means not accepting anything for personal sense enjoyment.
        Devotional service means engaging everything for the satisfaction of the
        Supreme Personality of Godhead.
