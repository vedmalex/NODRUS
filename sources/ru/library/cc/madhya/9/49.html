        Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that according to the Buddhist cult
        there are two ways of understanding philosophy. One is called Hīnāyāna,
        and the other is called Mahāyāna
        <i></i>
        . Along the Buddhist path there are nine principles: (1) The creation is
        eternal; therefore there is no need to accept a creator. (2) This cosmic
        manifestation is false. (3) “I am” is the truth. (4) There is repetition
        of birth and death. (5) Lord Buddha is the only source of understanding
        the truth. (6) The principle of
        <i>nirvāṇa</i>
        , or annihilation, is the ultimate goal. (7) The philosophy of Buddha is
        the only philosophical path. (8) The
        <i>Vedas</i>
        are compiled by human beings. (9) Pious activities, showing mercy to
        others and so on are advised.

        No one can attain the Absolute Truth by argument. One may be very expert
        in logic, and another person may be even more expert in the art of
        argument. Because there is so much word jugglery in logic, one can never
        come to the real conclusion about the Absolute Truth by argument. The
        followers of the Vedic principles understand this. However, it is seen
        here that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu defeated the Buddhist philosophy by
        argument. Those who are preachers in ISKCON will certainly meet many
        people who believe in intellectual arguments. Most of these people do
        not believe in the authority of the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        . Nevertheless, they accept intellectual speculation and argument.
        Therefore the preachers of Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be prepared to
        defeat others by argument, just as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did. In this
        verse it is clearly said,
        <i>tarkei khaṇḍila prabhu</i>
        . Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu put forward such a strong argument that
        the Buddhists could not counter Him to establish their cult.

        Their first principle is that the creation has always existed. But if
        this were the case, there could be no theory of annihilation. The
        Buddhists maintain that annihilation, or dissolution, is the highest
        truth. If the creation eternally exists, there is no question of
        dissolution or annihilation. This argument is not very strong because by
        practical experience we see that material things have a beginning, a
        middle and an end. The ultimate aim of the Buddhist philosophy is to
        dissolve the body. This is proposed because the body has a beginning.
        Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation is a gigantic body, but if we
        accept that it always exists, there can be no question of annihilation.
        Therefore the attempt to annihilate everything in order to attain zero
        is an absurdity. By our own practical experience we have to accept the
        beginning of creation, and when we accept the beginning, we must accept
        a creator. Such a creator must possess an all-pervasive body, as pointed
        out in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (13.14):

        The Supreme Person must be present everywhere. His body existed before
        the creation; otherwise He could not be the creator. If the Supreme
        Person is a created being, there can be no question of a creator. The
        conclusion is that the cosmic manifestation is certainly created at a
        certain time, and the creator existed before the creation; therefore the
        creator is not a created being. The creator is Parabrahman, or the
        Supreme Spirit. Matter is not only subordinate to spirit but is actually
        created on the basis of spirit. When the spirit soul enters the womb of
        a mother, the body is created by material ingredients supplied by the
        mother. Everything is created in the material world, and consequently
        there must be a creator who is the Supreme Spirit and who is distinct
        from matter. It is confirmed in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        that the material energy is inferior and that the spiritual energy is
        the living entity. Both inferior and superior energies belong to a
        supreme person.

        The Buddhists argue that the world is false, but this is not valid. The
        world is temporary, but it is not false. As long as we have the body, we
        must suffer the pleasures and pains of the body, even though we are not
        the body. We may not take these pleasures and pains very seriously, but
        they are factual nonetheless. We cannot actually say that they are
        false. If the bodily pains and pleasures were false, the creation would
        be false also, and consequently no one would take very much interest in
        it. The conclusion is that the material creation is not false or
        imaginary, but it is temporary.

        The Buddhists maintain that the principle “I am” is the ultimate truth,
        but this excludes the individuality of “I” and “you.” If there is no “I”
        and “you,” or individuality, there is no possibility of argument. The
        Buddhist philosophy depends on argument, but there can be no argument if
        one simply depends on “I am.” There must be a “you,” or another person
        also. The philosophy of duality — the existence of the individual soul
        and the Supersoul — must be there. This is confirmed in the second
        chapter of the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (2.12), wherein the Lord says:

        We existed in the past in different bodies, and after the annihilation
        of this body we shall exist in another body. The principle of the soul
        is eternal, and it exists in this body or in another body. Even in this
        lifetime we experience existence in a child’s body, a youth’s body, a
        man’s body and an old body. After the annihilation of the body, we
        acquire another body. The Buddhist cult also accepts the philosophy of
        transmigration, but the Buddhists do not properly explain the next
        birth. There are 8,400,000 species of life, and our next birth may be in
        any one of them; therefore this human body is not guaranteed.

        According to the Buddhists’ fifth principle, Lord Buddha is the only
        source for the attainment of knowledge. We cannot accept this, for Lord
        Buddha rejected the principles of Vedic knowledge. One must accept a
        principle of standard knowledge because one cannot attain the Absolute
        Truth simply by intellectual speculation. If everyone is an authority,
        or if everyone accepts his own intelligence as the ultimate criterion —
        as is presently fashionable — the scriptures will be interpreted in many
        different ways, and everyone will claim that his own philosophy is
        supreme. This has become a very great problem, and everyone is
        interpreting scripture in his own way and setting up his own basis of
        authority.
        <i>Yata mata tata patha</i>
        . Now everybody and anybody is trying to establish his own theory as the
        ultimate truth. The Buddhists theorize that annihilation, or
        <i>nirvāṇa</i>
        , is the ultimate goal. Annihilation applies to the body, but the spirit
        soul transmigrates from one body to another. If this were not the case,
        how can so many multifarious bodies come into existence? If the next
        birth is a fact, the next bodily form is also a fact. As soon as we
        accept a material body, we must accept the fact that that body will be
        annihilated and that we will have to accept another body. If all
        material bodies are doomed to annihilation, we must obtain a nonmaterial
        body, or a spiritual body, if we wish the next birth to be anything but
        false. How the spiritual body is attained is explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa in
        the

        This is the highest perfection — to give up one’s material body and not
        accept another but to return home, back to Godhead. It is not that
        perfection means one’s existence becomes void or zero. Existence
        continues, but if we positively want to annihilate the material body, we
        have to accept a spiritual body; otherwise there can be no eternality
        for the soul.

        We cannot accept the theory that the Buddhist philosophy is the only
        way, for there are so many defects in that philosophy. A perfect
        philosophy is one that has no defects, and that is Vedānta philosophy.
        No one can point out any defects in Vedānta philosophy, and therefore we
        can conclude that Vedānta is the supreme philosophical way of
        understanding the truth. According to the Buddhist cult, the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        are compiled by ordinary human beings. If this were the case, they would
        not be authoritative. From the Vedic literatures we understand that
        shortly after the creation Lord Brahmā was instructed in the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        . It is not that the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        were created by Brahmā, although Brahmā is the original person in the
        universe. If Brahmā did not create the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        but he is acknowledged as the first created being, wherefrom did Vedic
        knowledge come to Brahmā? Obviously the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        did not come from an ordinary person born in this material world.
        According to
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye</i>
        : after the creation, the Supreme Person imparted Vedic knowledge within
        the heart of Brahmā. There was no person in the beginning of the
        creation other than Brahmā, yet he did not compile the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        ; therefore the conclusion is that the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        were not compiled by any created being. Vedic knowledge was given by the
        Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created this material world. This is
        also accepted by Śaṅkarācārya, although he is not a Vaiṣṇava.

        It is stated that mercy is one of the qualities of a Buddhist, but mercy
        is a relative thing. We show our mercy to a subordinate or to one who is
        suffering more than ourselves. However, if there is a superior person
        present, the superior person cannot be the object of our mercy. Rather,
        we are objects for the mercy of the superior person. Therefore showing
        compassion and mercy is a relative activity. It is not the Absolute
        Truth. Apart from this, we also must know what actual mercy is. To give
        a sick man something forbidden for him to eat is not mercy. Rather, it
        is cruelty. Unless we know what mercy really is, we may create an
        undesirable situation. If we wish to show real mercy, we will preach
        Kṛṣṇa consciousness in order to revive the lost consciousness of human
        beings, the living entity’s original consciousness. Since the Buddhist
        philosophy does not admit the existence of the spirit soul, the
        so-called mercy of the Buddhists is defective.
