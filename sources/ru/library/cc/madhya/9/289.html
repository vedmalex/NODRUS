        Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks that up to the advent of
        His Holiness Śrīpāda Lakṣmīpati Tīrtha, it was the system in the
        disciplic succession of Madhvācārya to worship Lord Kṛṣṇa alone. After
        Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī, worship of both Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa was established.
        For this reason Śrī Mādhavendra Purī is accepted as the root of worship
        in ecstatic love. Unless one is connected to the disciplic succession of
        Mādhavendra Purī, there is no possibility of awakening the symptoms of
        ecstatic love. The word
        <i>gosāñi</i>
        is significant in this connection. The spiritual master who is fully
        surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and has no business
        other than the Lord’s service is called the best of the
        <i>paramahaṁsas.</i>
        A
        <i>paramahaṁsa</i>
        has no program for sense gratification; he is interested only in
        satisfying the senses of the Lord. One who has control of the senses in
        this way is called a
        <i>gosāñi</i>
        or a
        <i>gosvāmī,</i>
        master of the senses. The senses cannot be controlled unless one is
        engaged in the service of the Lord; therefore the bona fide spiritual
        master, who has full control over his senses, engages twenty-four hours
        a day in the Lord’s service. He can therefore be addressed as
        <i>gosāñi</i>
        or
        <i>gosvāmī.</i>
        The title
        <i>gosvāmī</i>
        cannot be inherited but can be given only to a bona fide spiritual
        master.

        There were six great Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana — Śrīla Rūpa, Sanātana,
        Bhaṭṭa Raghunātha, Śrī Jīva, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa and Dāsa Raghunātha — and
        none of them inherited the title of
        <i>gosvāmī.</i>
        All the Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana were bona fide spiritual masters situated
        on the highest platform of devotional service, and for that reason they
        were called
        <i>gosvāmīs.</i>
        All the temples of Vṛndāvana were certainly started by the six Gosvāmīs.
        Later the worship in the temples was entrusted to some householder
        disciples of the Gosvāmīs, and since then the hereditary title of
        <i>gosvāmī</i>
        has been used. However, only one who is a bona fide spiritual master
        expanding the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness
        movement, and who is in full control of his senses can be addressed as a
        <i>gosvāmī.</i>
        Unfortunately, the hereditary process is going on; therefore at the
        present moment, in most cases the title is being misused due to
        ignorance of the word’s etymology.
