      <p>
        Lord Caitanya’s mission is to deliver the fallen souls of this age. In
        this Age of Kali, practically cent percent of the population is fallen.
        Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu certainly delivered many fallen souls, but His
        disciples mainly came from the upper classes. For example, He delivered
        Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and many
        others who were socially elevated but fallen from the spiritual point of
        view. Śrīla Rūpa and Sanātana Gosvāmīs were situated in government
        service, and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was the topmost scholar of India.
        Similarly, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī was a leader of many thousands of
        Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs.</i>
        It was Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu, however, who delivered persons like
        Jagāi and Mādhāi. Therefore, Lord Caitanya says,
        <i>āmāra ‘duṣkara’ karma, tomā haite haye.</i>
        Jagāi and Mādhāi were delivered solely by Nityānanda Prabhu’s mercy.
        When they injured Nityānanda Prabhu, Lord Caitanya became angry and
        decided to kill them with His Sudarśana
        <i>cakra,</i>
        but Nityānanda Prabhu saved them from the Lord’s wrath and delivered
        them. In the incarnation of Gaura-Nitāi, the Lord is not supposed to
        kill demons but is supposed to deliver them by preaching Kṛṣṇa
        consciousness. In the case of Jagāi and Mādhāi, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu
        was so angry that He would have immediately killed them, but Nityānanda
        Prabhu was so kind that He not only saved them from death but elevated
        them to the transcendental position. Thus what was not possible for Śrī
        Caitanya Mahāprabhu was carried out by Nityānanda Prabhu.

        Similarly, if one is true to Gaura-Nitāi’s service in the disciplic
        succession, he can even excel Nityānanda Prabhu’s service. This is the
        process of disciplic succession. Nityānanda Prabhu delivered Jagāi and
        Mādhāi, but a servant of Nityānanda Prabhu, by His grace, can deliver
        many thousands of Jagāis and Mādhāis. That is the special benediction of
        the disciplic succession. One who is situated in the disciplic
        succession can be understood by the result of his activities. This is
        always true as far as the activities of the Lord and His devotees are
        concerned. Therefore Lord Śiva says:

        “Of all types of worship, worship of Lord Viṣṇu is best, and better than

        By the grace of Viṣṇu, a Vaiṣṇava can render better service than Viṣṇu;
        that is the special prerogative of a Vaiṣṇava. The Lord actually wants
        to see His servants work more gloriously than Himself. For instance, on
        the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, Śrī Kṛṣṇa provoked Arjuna to fight
        because all the warriors on the battlefield were to die by Kṛṣṇa’s plan.
        Kṛṣṇa Himself did not want to take credit; rather, He wanted Arjuna to
        take credit. Therefore He asked him to fight and win fame:

        and enjoy a flourishing kingdom. They are already put to death by My

        Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives credit to a devotee who
        performs any heavy task perfectly. Hanumānjī, or Vajrāṅgajī, the servant
        of Lord Rāmacandra, serves as another example. It was Hanumānjī who
        jumped over the sea in one leap and reached the shore of Laṅkā from the
        shore of Bhārata-varṣa. When Lord Rāmacandra chose to go there, He paved
        the way with stones, although by His will the stones were able to float
        on the sea. If we simply follow Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s instructions
        and follow in the footsteps of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, this Kṛṣṇa
        consciousness movement can advance, and even more difficult tasks can be
        performed by the preachers remaining faithful to the service of the
        Lord.
