        The source of our income is not actually the source of our maintenance.
        Every living being — from the great Brahmā down to an insignificant ant
        — is being maintained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
        <i>Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</i>
        The one Supreme Being, Kṛṣṇa, maintains everyone. Our so-called source
        of income is our own choice only. If I wish to be a hunter, it will
        appear that hunting is the source of my maintenance. If I become a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        and completely depend on Kṛṣṇa, I do not conduct a business, but
        nonetheless my maintenance is supplied by Kṛṣṇa. The hunter was
        disturbed about breaking his bow because he was worried about his
        income. Nārada Muni assured the hunter because he knew that the hunter
        was not being maintained by the bow but by Kṛṣṇa. Being the agent of
        Kṛṣṇa, Nārada Muni knew very well that the hunter would not suffer by
        breaking the bow. There was no doubt that Kṛṣṇa would supply him food.
