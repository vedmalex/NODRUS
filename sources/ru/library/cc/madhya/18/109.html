        This is the viewpoint of Māyāvāda philosophy. Māyāvāda philosophy
        supports the impersonalist view that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality
        of Godhead, has no form. One can imagine impersonal Brahman in any form
        — as Viṣṇu, Lord Śiva, Vivasvān, Gaṇeśa or Devī Durgā. According to the
        Māyāvāda philosophy, when one becomes a
        <i>sannyāsī</i>
        he is to be considered a moving Nārāyaṇa. Māyāvāda philosophy holds that
        the real Nārāyaṇa does not move because, being impersonal, He has no
        legs. Thus according to Māyāvāda philosophy, whoever becomes a
        <i>sannyāsī</i>
        declares himself Nārāyaṇa. Foolish people accept such ordinary human
        beings as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called
        <i>vivarta-vāda</i>.

        In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that
        <i>jaṅgama-nārāyaṇa</i>
        means that the impersonal Brahman takes a shape and moves here and there
        in the form of a Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsī</i>.
        The Māyāvāda philosophy confirms this.
        <i>Daṇḍa-grahaṇa-mātreṇa naro nārāyaṇo bhavet</i>:
        “Simply by accepting the
        <i>daṇḍa</i>
        of the order of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>,
        one is immediately transformed into Nārāyaṇa.” Therefore Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>
        address one another by saying
        <i>oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya</i>.
        In this way one Nārāyaṇa worships another Nārāyaṇa.

        Actually an ordinary human being cannot become Nārāyaṇa. As the chief
        Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsī</i>,
        Śrī Śaṅkarācārya, says,
        <i>nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt</i>:
        “Nārāyaṇa is not a creation of this material world. Nārāyaṇa is above
        the material creation.” Due to their poor fund of knowledge, Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>
        think that Nārāyaṇa, the Absolute Truth, takes birth as a human being
        and that when He realizes this, He becomes Nārāyaṇa again. They never
        consider why Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, would accept
        an inferior position as a human being and then again become Nārāyaṇa
        when He is perfect. Why should Nārāyaṇa be imperfect? Why should He
        appear as a human being? Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very nicely explained
        these points while at Vṛndāvana.
