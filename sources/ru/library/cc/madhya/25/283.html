          The Caitanya-caritāmṛta pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu
          constitute a very secret literature. It is the life and soul of all
          devotees. Those who are not fit to relish this literature, who are
          envious like hogs and pigs, will certainly not adore it. However, this
          will not harm my attempt. These pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya
          Mahāprabhu will certainly please all saintly people who have clear
          hearts. They will certainly enjoy it. We wish that this will enhance
          their enjoyment more and more.

        The author of
        <i>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>,
        Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, has condemned all his enemies by comparing
        them to envious hogs and pigs. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, which
        is spreading throughout the world, is being appreciated by sincere
        people, although they have never previously heard of Śrī Caitanya
        Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. Now even the higher, priestly circles
        are appreciating this movement. They have concluded that this movement
        is very nice and that they have something to learn from it. Nonetheless,
        in India there are some people who say that they belong to this cult but
        who are actually very envious of the
        <i>ācārya</i>.
        They have tried to suppress our activities in many ways, but as far as
        we are concerned, we follow in the footsteps of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja
        Gosvāmī and take them as envious pigs and hogs. We simply wish to
        present the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to the
        best of our ability so that those who are really honest can cleanse
        their hearts. We hope that they enjoy this literature and bestow their
        blessings upon us. It appears that even such a great personality as
        Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī met with some envious obstacles; what, then,
        to speak of us, who are only insignificant creatures in this universe.
        We are simply trying to execute the orders of our spiritual master to
        the best of our ability.
