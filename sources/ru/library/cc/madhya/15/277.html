        The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases — impersonal Brahman,
        Paramātmā and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān. All of these
        are one and the same truth, but Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān
        constitute three different features. Whoever understands Brahman is
        called a
        <i>brāhmaṇa,</i>
        and when a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        engages in the Lord’s devotional service, he is called a Vaiṣṇava.
        Unless one comes to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his
        realization of impersonal Brahman is imperfect. A
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        can chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa
        <i>mantra</i>
        on the platform of
        <i>nāmābhāsa,</i>
        but not on the platform of pure vibration. When a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        engages in the Lord’s service, fully understanding his eternal
        relationship, his devotional service is called
        <i>abhidheya.</i>
        When one attains that stage, he is called a
        <i>bhāgavata,</i>
        or Vaiṣṇava. This indicates that he is free from contamination and
        material attachment. Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (7.28):

        A
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        may be a very learned scholar, but this does not mean that he is free
        from material contamination. A
        <i>brāhmaṇa’s</i>
        contamination, however, is in the mode of goodness. In the material
        world, the three modes are goodness, passion and ignorance, and all of
        these are simply different gradations of contamination. Unless a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        transcends such contamination and approaches the platform of unalloyed
        devotional service, he cannot be accepted as a Vaiṣṇava. An
        impersonalist may be aware of the impersonal Brahman feature of the
        Absolute Truth, but his activities are on the impersonal platform.
        Sometimes he imagines a form of the Lord (
        <i>saguṇa-upāsanā</i>
        ), but such an attempt is never successful in helping one attain
        complete realization. The impersonalist may consider himself a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        and may be situated in the mode of goodness, but nonetheless he is
        conditioned by one of the modes of material nature. This means that he
        is not yet liberated, for liberation cannot be attained unless one is
        completely free from the modes. In any case, the Māyāvāda philosophy
        keeps one conditioned. If one becomes a Vaiṣṇava through proper
        initiation, he automatically becomes a
        <i>brāhmaṇa.</i>
        There is no doubt about it. The
        <i>Garuḍa Purāṇa</i>
        confirms this:

        Out of many thousands of such qualified

        one may be fully aware of the Vedānta philosophy. Out of many millions
        of learned Vedānta scholars, there may be one

        Unless one is a fully qualified
        <i>brāhmaṇa,</i>
        he cannot advance in the spiritual science. A real
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        is never envious of Vaiṣṇavas. If he is, he is considered an imperfect
        neophyte. Impersonalist
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        are always opposed to Vaiṣṇava principles. They are envious of Vaiṣṇavas
        because they do not know the goal of life.
        <i>Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum.</i>
        However, when a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        becomes a Vaiṣṇava, there is no duality. If a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        does not become a Vaiṣṇava, he certainly falls down from the
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        platform. This is confirmed by
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        (11.5.3):
        <i>na bhajanty avajānanti sthānād bhraṣṭāḥ patanty adhaḥ.</i>

        We can actually see that in this Age of Kali many so-called
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        are envious of Vaiṣṇavas. The Kali-contaminated
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        consider Deity worship to be imaginative:
        <i>arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.</i>
        Such a contaminated
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        may superficially imagine a form of the Lord, but actually he considers
        the Deity in the temple to be made of stone or wood. Similarly, such a
        contaminated
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        considers the
        <i>guru</i>
        to be an ordinary human being, and he objects when a Vaiṣṇava is created
        by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Many so-called
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        attempt to fight us, saying, “How can you create a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        out of a European or American? A
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        can be born only in a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        family.” They do not consider that this is never stated in any revealed
        scripture. Lord Kṛṣṇa specifically states in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (4.13),
        <i>cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:</i>
        “According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated
        with them, the four divisions of human society are created by Me.”

    <div id="bb1101122" class="r r-lang-ru r-paragraph">

        Thus a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        is not a result of the caste system. He becomes a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        only by qualification. Similarly, a Vaiṣṇava does not belong to a
        particular caste; rather, his designation is determined by the rendering
        of devotional service.
