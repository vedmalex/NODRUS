      <p>
        Due to pious activities, one can be enriched by four opulences: one may
        obtain birth in an aristocratic family, become highly educated, become
        very beautiful or get a sufficient quantity of riches. These are
        symptoms of pious activities performed in one’s past life. In India it
        is still current for an aristocratic family never to consider a marriage
        with a common family. Though the caste may be the same, to maintain the
        aristocracy such marriages are rejected. No poor man will dare marry the
        daughter of a rich man. Because of this, when the elderly
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        offered the young
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        his daughter, the young
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        did not believe that it would be possible to marry her. Therefore he
        asked the elderly
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        why he was proposing something unprecedented (
        <i>asambhava</i>
        )
        <i></i>
        . It was unheard of for an aristocratic person to offer his daughter to
        a person who was both uneducated and poor.
