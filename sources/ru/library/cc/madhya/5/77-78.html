          Taking this opportunity, the elderly brāhmaṇa immediately confirmed
          that this was really true. He said, “If Gopāla personally comes here
          to serve as a witness, I shall surely give my daughter to the young
          brāhmaṇa.”

        As the Supersoul within the heart of all living entities, Kṛṣṇa knows
        everyone’s desire, everyone’s request and everyone’s prayer. Although
        all these may be contradictory, the Lord has to create a situation in
        which everyone will be pleased. This is an instance of a marriage
        negotiation between an elderly
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        and a youthful one. The elderly
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        was certainly willing to give his daughter in charity to the young
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        , but his son and relatives became impediments to this transaction. The
        elderly
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        considered how to get out of this situation and still offer his daughter
        to the young
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        . His son, an atheist and a very cunning fellow, was thinking of how to
        stop the marriage. The father and son were thinking in a contradictory
        way, yet Kṛṣṇa created a situation wherein they agreed. They both agreed
        that if the Gopāla Deity would come and serve as a witness, the daughter
        would be given to the young
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        .
