        In the
        <i>Caitanya-bhāgavata</i>
        (
        <i>Antya-khaṇḍa</i>
        , chapter two) it is said that when Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived
        at Śrī Bhuvaneśvara, He visited the temple of Lord Śiva known as
        Gupta-kāśī (the concealed Vārāṇasī). Lord Śiva established this as a
        place of pilgrimage by bringing water from all holy places and creating
        the lake known as Bindu-sarovara. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took His bath
        in this lake, feeling a great regard for Lord Śiva. From the spiritual
        point of view, people still go to take a bath in this lake. Actually, by
        taking a bath there, one becomes very healthy even from the material
        viewpoint. Taking a bath and drinking the water of this lake can cure
        any disease of the stomach. Regular bathing certainly cures indigestion.
        The river Bhārgī, or Bhārgīnadī, came to be known as the
        Daṇḍa-bhāṅgā-nadī after Lord Caitanya bathed in its waters. It is
        situated six miles north of Jagannātha Purī. The reason for the change
        in names is given as follows.
