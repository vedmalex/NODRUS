        Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following commentary
        on the words
        <i>bhāgavata vicāra</i>.
        As confirmed in the
        <i>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</i>
        (1.1.4-5), there are two kinds of educational systems:

        “There are two kinds of educational systems. One deals with
        transcendental knowledge [
        <i>parā vidyā</i>
        ] and the other with material knowledge [
        <i>aparā vidyā</i>
        ]
        <i></i>.
        All the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        — the
        <i>Ṛg Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda</i>
        and
        <i>Atharva Veda</i>,
        along with their corollaries, known as
        <i>śikṣā, kalpa, vyākaraṇa, nirukta, chanda</i>
        and
        <i>jyotiṣa</i>
        — belong to the inferior system of material knowledge [
        <i>aparā vidyā</i>
        ]
        <i></i>.
        By
        <i>parā vidyā</i>
        one can understand the
        <i>akṣara</i>
        — Brahman or the Absolute Truth.” As far as the Vedic literature is
        concerned, the
        <i>Vedānta-sūtra</i>
        is accepted as the
        <i>parā vidyā. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        is an explanation of that
        <i>parā vidyā</i>.
        Those who aspire for liberation (
        <i>mukti</i>
        or
        <i>mokṣa</i>
        ) and introduce themselves as
        <i>vaidāntika</i>
        are also equal to those groups aspiring to improve religion (
        <i>dharma</i>
        )
        <i></i>,
        economic development (
        <i>artha</i>
        ) and sense gratification (
        <i>kāma</i>
        )
        <i>. Dharma, artha, kāma</i>
        and
        <i>mokṣa</i>
        are called
        <i>catur-varga</i>.
        They are all within the system of inferior, material knowledge. Any
        literature giving information about the spiritual world, spiritual life,
        spiritual identity and the spirit soul is called
        <i>parā vidyā. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        does not have anything to do with the materialistic way of life; it
        gives transcendental information to educate people in the superior
        system of
        <i>parā vidyā</i>.
        Sanātana Gosvāmī was engaged in discussing the
        <i>bhāgavata-vidyā</i>,
        which means he discussed transcendental superior knowledge. Those who
        are
        <i>karmīs, jñānīs</i>
        or
        <i>yogīs</i>
        are not actually fit to discuss
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>.
        Only Vaiṣṇavas, or pure devotees, are fit to discuss that literature. As
        stated in
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        itself (12.13.18):

        Although
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        is counted among the
        <i>Purāṇas</i>,
        it is called the spotless
        <i>Purāṇa</i>.
        Because it does not discuss anything material, it is liked by
        transcendental Vaiṣṇava devotees. The subject matter found in
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        is meant for
        <i>paramahaṁsas</i>.
        As it is said,
        <i>paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vedyam. A paramahaṁsa</i>
        is one who does not live in the material world and who does not envy
        others. In
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>,
        devotional service is discussed to arouse the living entity to the
        transcendental position of
        <i>jñāna</i>
        (knowledge) and
        <i>vairāgya</i>

        “The seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowledge
        and detachment, realizes that Absolute Truth by rendering devotional
        service in terms of what he has heard from the
        <i>Vedānta-śruti</i>
        .”

        This is not sentiment. Knowledge and renunciation can be obtained
        through devotional service (
        <i>bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā</i>
        ), that is, by arousing one’s dormant devotional consciousness, Kṛṣṇa
        consciousness. When Kṛṣṇa consciousness is aroused, it relieves one from
        fruitive activity, activity for economic improvement and material
        enjoyment. This relief is technically called
        <i>naiṣkarmya</i>,
        and when one is relieved, he is no longer interested in working hard for
        sense gratification.
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        is Śrīla Vyāsadeva’s last, mature contribution, and one should read and
        hear it in an assembly of realized souls while engaging in devotional
        service. At such a time one can be liberated from all material bondage.
        This was the course taken by Sanātana Gosvāmī, who retired from
        government service to study
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        with learned scholars.
