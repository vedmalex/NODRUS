        Lord Kṛṣṇa has many forms, as stated in the
        <i>Brahma-saṁhitā</i>
        (5.33):
        <i>advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam</i>
        . Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Raghupati Upādhyāya which form was the
        best of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s millions of forms, and he immediately replied that
        the supreme form was the Śyāmasundara form. In that form, Kṛṣṇa stands
        curved in three places and holds His flute. The Śyāmasundara form is
        also described in the
        <i>Brahma-saṁhitā</i>
        (5.38):

        “I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee
        whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal

        Those who are filled with ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa always see the form of
        Śyāmasundara within their hearts. Raghupati Upādhyāya confirms that the
        Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has many
        incarnations — Nārāyaṇa, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha and others — but Kṛṣṇa is
        distinguished as the supermost. According to
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        (1.3.28),
        <i>kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</i>
        : “Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead.” Kṛṣṇa means
        Śyāmasundara, who plays His flute in Vṛndāvana. Of all forms, this form
        is the best of all. Kṛṣṇa lives sometimes in Mathurā and sometimes in
        Dvārakā, but Mathurā is considered the better place. This is also
        confirmed by Rūpa Gosvāmī in his
        <i>Upadeśāmṛta</i>
        (9):
        <i>vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā madhu-purī</i>
        . “Madhu-purī, or Mathurā, is far superior to the Vaikuṇṭhalokas in the
        spiritual world.”
