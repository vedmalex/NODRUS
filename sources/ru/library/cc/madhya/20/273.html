        In the present verse of the
        <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>,
        the word
        <i>prakṛti-sparśana</i>
        refers to the Lord’s glancing over material nature and placing the
        living entities in contact with dull matter. The glancing is performed
        by Mahā-Viṣṇu:
        <i>sa aikṣata lokān nu sṛjā iti</i>.
        (
        <i>Aitareya Upaniṣad</i>
        1.1.1) In the conditioned stage we impregnate according to the bodily
        conception — that is, by sexual intercourse — but the Supreme Lord does
        not need sexual intercourse to impregnate. The impregnation is performed
        simply by His glance. This is also explained in the
        <i>Brahma-saṁhitā</i>

        Govinda can impregnate simply by glancing. In other words, His eyes can
        work as His genitals. He does not need genitals to beget a child.
        Indeed, Kṛṣṇa can beget any one of the living entities with any part of
        His body.

        The word
        <i>svāṅga-viśeṣābhāsa-rūpe</i>,
        indicating the form by which the Lord begets living entities in the
        material world, is explained herein. He is Lord Śiva. In the
        <i>Brahma-saṁhitā</i>
        it is stated that Lord Śiva, who is another form of Mahā-Viṣṇu, is like
        yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. Similarly, Lord
        Śiva is considered the father of this universe, and material nature is
        considered the mother. The father and mother are known as Lord Śiva and
        goddess Durgā. Together, Lord Śiva’s genitals and the vagina of goddess
        Durgā are worshiped as the
        <i>śiva-liṅga</i>.
        This is the origin of the material creation. Thus Lord Śiva’s position
        is between that of the living entity and that of the Supreme Lord. In
        other words, Lord Śiva is neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead nor
        a living entity. He is the form through which the Supreme Lord works to
        beget living entities within this material world. As yogurt is prepared
        when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Lord Śiva expands when
        the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material nature. The
        impregnation of material nature by the father, Lord Śiva, is wonderful
        because at one time innumerable living entities are conceived.

        The innumerable
        <i>brahmāṇḍas</i>,
        or universes, come from the pores of the Lord’s body, and innumerable
        living entities also come from the pores of the transcendental body of
        the Lord. This is the process of material creation. Without the living
        entities, this material nature has no value. Both emanate from the pores
        of the transcendental body of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu. They are different
        energies. The material nature is explained as follows by Lord Kṛṣṇa in

        “Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego — all
        together these eight constitute My separated material energies.” Thus
        the material elements also come from the body of the Supreme Personality
        of Godhead, but they are a different type of energy from the living
        entities. Although the living entities also come from the Lord’s body,
        they are categorized as a superior energy:

        “Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another,
        superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are
        exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.” (Bg. 7.5)
        The inferior energy, matter, cannot act without the superior energy. All
        these things are very clearly explained in the
        <i>Vedas</i>.
        The materialistic theory that life develops from matter is incorrect.
        Life and matter come from the supreme living entity; therefore, being
        the source of both, that supreme living entity, Kṛṣṇa, is described in
        the
        <i>Vedānta-sūtra</i>
        as
        <i>janmādy asya yataḥ</i>
        (1.1), or the original source of everything,
        <i>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</i>.
