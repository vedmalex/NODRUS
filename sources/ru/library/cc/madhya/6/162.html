        The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature the master of all
        potencies. By nature, the living entities, being infinitesimal, are
        always under the influence of the Lord’s potencies. According to the
        <i>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</i>
        (3.1.1-2):

        The
        <i>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</i>
        completely distinguishes the Lord from the living entities. The living
        entity is subjected to the reactions of fruitive activity, whereas the
        Lord simply witnesses such activity and bestows the results. According
        to the living entity’s desires, he is wandering from one body to another
        and from one planet to another, under the direction of the Supreme
        Personality of Godhead, Paramātmā. However, when the living entity comes
        to his senses by the mercy of the Lord, he is awarded devotional
        service. Thus he is saved from the clutches of
        <i>māyā.</i>
        At such a time he can see his eternal friend, the Supreme Personality of
        Godhead, and become free from all lamentation and hankering. This is
        confirmed in the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (18.54), where the Lord says,
        <i>brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati:</i>
        “One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme
        Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have
        anything.” Thus it is definitely proved that the Supreme Personality of
        Godhead is the master of all potencies and that the living entities are
        always subjected to these potencies. That is the difference between
        <i>māyādhīśa</i>
        and
        <i>māyā-vaśa.</i>
