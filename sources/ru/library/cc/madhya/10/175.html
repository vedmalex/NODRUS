        Brahmānanda Bhāratī admitted that when there is an argument between the
        spiritual master and the disciple, the spiritual master is naturally
        victorious, although the disciple may put forward a strong argument. In
        other words, it is customary that the words of the spiritual master are
        more worshipable than the words of a disciple. Under the circumstances,
        since Brahmānanda Bhāratī was in the position of a spiritual master, he
        emerged victorious over Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who considered Himself
        Brahmānanda Bhāratī’s disciple. However, Brahmānanda Bhāratī reversed
        the argument and took the position of a devotee, stating that Śrī
        Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. This
        means that the Lord was voluntarily defeated out of affection for His
        devotee. He was defeated voluntarily, because no one can defeat the
        Supreme Lord. Concerning this, the words of Bhīṣma in
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        (1.9.37) are important:

        “Fulfilling my desire and sacrificing His own promise, He got down from
        the chariot, took up its wheel and ran toward me hurriedly, just as a
        lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment on the
        way.”

        Kṛṣṇa promised not to fight in the Battle of Kurukṣetra, but Bhīṣma, in
        order to break Kṛṣṇa’s promise, attacked Arjuna in such a vigorous way
        that Kṛṣṇa was obliged to take up a chariot wheel and attack Bhīṣma. The
        Lord did this to show that His devotee was being maintained at the
        sacrifice of His own promise. Brahmānanda Bhāratī said, “Since the
        beginning of my life I was attached to impersonal Brahman realization,
        but as soon as I saw You, I became very much attached to the Personality
        of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.” Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Lord Kṛṣṇa
        Himself, and thus Brahmānanda Bhāratī became His devotee.
