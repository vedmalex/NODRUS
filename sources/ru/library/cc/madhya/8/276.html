          “ ‘The plants, creepers and trees were full of fruits and flowers due
          to ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, being so full, they were bowing
          down. They were inspired by such deep love for Kṛṣṇa that they were
          constantly pouring showers of honey. In this way the gopīs saw all the
          forests of Vṛndāvana.’ ”

        This verse (
        <i>Bhāg</i>.
        10.35.9) is one of the songs the
        <i>gopīs</i>
        sang during Kṛṣṇa’s absence. In Kṛṣṇa’s absence the
        <i>gopīs</i>
        were always absorbed in thought of Him. Similarly, the
        <i>mahā-bhāgavata</i>,
        the advanced devotee, sees everything as potentially serving the Lord.
        Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states:

        The advanced devotee does not see anything as unconnected with Kṛṣṇa.
        Unlike the Māyāvādī philosophers, a devotee does not see the material
        world as false, because he knows that everything in the material world
        is connected to Kṛṣṇa. A devotee knows how to utilize everything in the
        service of the Lord, and this is characteristic of the
        <i>mahā-bhāgavata</i>.
        The
        <i>gopīs</i>
        saw the plants, creepers and forest trees loaded with fruits and flowers
        and ready to serve Kṛṣṇa. In this way they immediately remembered their
        worshipable Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They did not simply see plants, creepers and
        trees the way a mundaner sees them.
