          Rāmānanda Rāya then replied, “Conjugal attachment for Kṛṣṇa is the

        In general, love of Godhead is devoid of the intimacy of ownership. In
        the case of love in servitude, there is a want of confidence. There is a
        want of increased affection in the fraternal relationship, and even when
        this affection increases in the parental relationship, there is
        nonetheless a want of complete freedom. However, when one becomes a
        conjugal lover of Kṛṣṇa, everything lacking in the other relationships
        is completely manifest. Love of Godhead lacks nothing in the conjugal
        stage. The summary of this verse is that parental love of Godhead is
        certainly higher than fraternal love and that conjugal love is higher
        yet. It was when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Rāmānanda Rāya to go
        further that he came to the point of the conjugal relationship, which is
        the highest perfectional stage of transcendental love.
