        Just as there are many orbs in the material world called stars or
        planets, in the spiritual world there are many spiritual planets called
        Vaikuṇṭhalokas. The spiritual universe, however, is situated far, far
        away from the cluster of material universes. Material scientists cannot
        even estimate the number of planets and stars within this universe. They
        are also incapable of traveling to other stars by spaceship. According
        to the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (8.20), there is also a spiritual world:

        “Yet there is another unmanifested nature, which is eternal and is
        transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme
        and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that
        part remains as it is.”

        Thus there is another nature, which is superior to material nature. The
        word
        <i>bhāva</i>
        or
        <i>svabhāva</i>
        refers to nature. The spiritual nature is eternal, and even when all the
        material universes are destroyed, the planets in the spiritual world
        abide. They remain exactly as the spirit soul remains even after the
        annihilation of the material body. That spiritual world is called the
        <i>aprākṛta</i>
        (antimaterial) world. In this transcendental, spiritual world or
        universe, the highest planetary system is known as Goloka Vṛndāvana.
        That is the abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, who is also all-spiritual.
        Kṛṣṇa is known there as Aprākṛta-madana. The name Madana refers to
        Cupid, but Kṛṣṇa is the spiritual Madana. His body is not material like
        the body of Cupid in this material universe. Kṛṣṇa’s body is
        all-spiritual —
        <i>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.</i>
        Therefore He is called Aprākṛta-madana. He is also known as
        Manmatha-madana, which means that He is attractive even to Cupid.
        Sometimes Kṛṣṇa’s activities and attractive features are misinterpreted
        by gross materialists who accuse Him of being immoral because He danced
        with the
        <i>gopīs,</i>
        but such an accusation results from not knowing that Kṛṣṇa is beyond
        this material world. His body is
        <i>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,</i>
        completely spiritual. There is no material contamination in His body,
        and one should not consider His body a lump of flesh and bones. The
        Māyāvādī philosophers conceive of Kṛṣṇa’s body as material, and this is
        an abominable, grossly materialistic conception. Just as Kṛṣṇa is
        completely spiritual, the
        <i>gopīs</i>
        are also spiritual, and this is confirmed in the
        <i>Brahma-saṁhitā</i>

        The
        <i>gopīs</i>
        are also of the same spiritual quality (
        <i>nija-rūpatayā</i>
        ) because they are expansions of Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure potency. Neither Kṛṣṇa
        nor the
        <i>gopīs</i>
        have anything to do with lumps of matter or the material conception. In
        the material world the living entity is encaged within a material body,
        and due to ignorance he thinks that he is the body. Therefore here the
        enjoyment of lusty desires between male and female is all material. One
        cannot compare the lusty desires of a materialistic man to the
        transcendental lusty desires of Kṛṣṇa. Unless one is advanced in
        spiritual science, he cannot understand the lusty desires between Kṛṣṇa
        and the
        <i>gopīs.</i>
        In the
        <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>
        the lusty desire of the
        <i>gopīs</i>
        is compared to gold. The lusty desires of a materialistic man, on the
        other hand, are compared to iron. At no stage can iron and gold be
        equal. The living entities — moving and nonmoving — are part and parcel
        of Kṛṣṇa; therefore they originally have the same kind of lusty desire
        as His. But when this lusty desire is expressed through matter, it is
        abominable. When a living entity is spiritually advanced and liberated
        from material bondage, he can understand Kṛṣṇa in truth. As stated in
        the

        his original consciousness. When that original consciousness is
        completely spiritual, it is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who lives in
        such consciousness is actually living in Vṛndāvana. He may live
        anywhere; material location doesn’t matter. When by the grace of Kṛṣṇa
        one thus advances, he becomes completely uncontaminated by the material
        body and mind and at that time factually lives in Vṛndāvana. That stage
