        The greatest reputation a living being can have is to be a devotee of
        Kṛṣṇa and to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the material world everyone
        is trying to be famous by accumulating a large bank balance or material
        opulence. There is a steady competition among
        <i>karmīs</i>
        attempting to advance in a wealthy society. The whole world is turning
        in accordance with that competitive mood. But this kind of name and fame
        is temporary, for it lasts only as long as the temporary material body
        exists. One may become famous as a
        <i>brahma-jñānī</i>
        , an impersonalist scholar, or one may become a materially opulent
        person. In either case, such reputations are inferior to the reputation
        of Kṛṣṇa’s devotee. In the
        <i>Garuḍa Purāṇa</i>
