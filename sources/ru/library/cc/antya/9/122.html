        Near Rajahmundry is a famous railway station. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta
        Sarasvatī notes that the present Rajahmundry City is located on the
        northern bank of the Godāvarī. At the time when Rāmānanda Rāya was
        governor, however, the state capital, which was known as Vidyānagara or
        Vidyāpura, was located on the southern side of the Godāvarī, at the
        confluence of the Godāvarī and the sea. That was the part of the country
        which at that time was known as Rajahmundry. North of Kaliṅga-deśa is
        Utkaliṅga, or the state of Orissa. The capital of southern Orissa was
        known as Rajahmundry, but now the location of Rajahmundry has changed.
