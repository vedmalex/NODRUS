        In this connection Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura again quotes
        the following verse from the
        <i>Sāhitya-darpaṇa</i>
        (6.288):

        Thus the technical names for the five kinds of introductory scenes of
        the drama are listed as
        <i>udghātyaka, kathodghāta, prayogātiśaya, pravartaka</i>
        and
        <i>avalagita</i>
        . When Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya inquired which of these five Śrīla Rūpa
        Gosvāmī had used to accomplish the technical introduction to his drama
        <i>Lalita-mādhava</i>
        , Rūpa Gosvāmī replied that he had used the introduction technically
        called
        <i>udghātyaka</i>
        . According to the
        <i>Bhāratī-vṛtti</i>
        , three technical terms used are
        <i>prarocanā, vīthī</i>
        and
        <i>prahasanā</i>
        . Thus Rūpa Gosvāmī also mentioned
        <i>vīthī</i>
        , which is a technical term for a certain type of expression. According
        to the
        <i>Sāhitya-darpaṇa</i>
        (6.520):

        The
        <i>vīthī</i>
        beginning of a drama consists of only one scene. In that scene, one of
        the heroes enters the stage, and by means of opposing statements uttered
        by a voice from the sky (offstage), he introduces the abundant conjugal
        mellow and other mellows to some degree. In the course of the
        introduction, all the seeds of the play are planted. This introduction
        is called
        <i>udghātyaka</i>
        because the player dances on the stage. This term also indicates that
        the full moon enters the stage. In this case, when the word
        <i>naṭatā</i>
        (“dancing on the stage”) is linked with the moon, its meaning is
        obscure, but because the meaning becomes very clear when the word
        <i>naṭatā</i>
        is linked with Kṛṣṇa, this type of introduction is called
        <i>udghātyaka</i>
        .

        Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya used highly technical terms when he discussed this
        subject with Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. Rūpa Gosvāmī stated that Śrīla
        Rāmānanda Rāya was a greatly learned scholar of bona fide dramatic
        composition. Thus although Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was quite fit to answer
        Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya’s questions, due to his Vaiṣṇava humility he said
        that his words were impudent. Actually both Rūpa Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda
        Rāya were scholarly experts in composing poetry and presenting it
        strictly according to the
        <i>Sāhitya-darpaṇa</i>
        and other Vedic literatures.
