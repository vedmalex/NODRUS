        The poet or writer dealing with transcendental subject matters is not an
        ordinary writer or translator. Because he is empowered by the Supreme
        Personality of Godhead, whatever he writes becomes very effective. The
        principle of being empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
        essential. A materialistic poet who describes in his poetry the material
        activities of men and women cannot describe the transcendental pastimes
        of the Lord or the transcendental conclusions of devotional service.
        Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has therefore warned all neophyte devotees that
        one should not hear from the mouth of a non-Vaiṣṇava:

        “One should not hear anything about Kṛṣṇa from a non-Vaiṣṇava. Milk
        touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects; similarly, talks
        about Kṛṣṇa given by a non-Vaiṣṇava are also poisonous.”

        Unless one is a fully unalloyed devotee of the Lord, one should not try
        to describe the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa in poetry, for it will be only
        mundane. There are many descriptions of Kṛṣṇa’s
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        written by persons whose consciousness is mundane and who are not
        qualified by pure devotion. Although they attempted to write
        transcendental literature, they could not fully engage even a single
        devotee in Kṛṣṇa’s service. Such literature is mundane, and therefore,
        as warned by Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, one should not touch it.
