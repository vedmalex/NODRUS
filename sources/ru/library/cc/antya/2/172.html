      <p>
        Summarizing this chapter, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says
        that one should derive from it the following lessons. (1) Although Śrī
        Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is an
        incarnation of mercy, He nevertheless gave up the company of one of His
        personal associates, namely Junior Haridāsa, for if He had not done so,
        pseudodevotees would have taken advantage of Junior Haridāsa’s fault by
        using it as an excuse to live as devotees and at the same time have
        illicit sexual connections. Such activities would have demoralized the
        cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and as a result, devotees would surely
        have gone to a hellish life in the name of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. (2)
        By chastising Junior Haridāsa, the Lord set the standard for
        <i>ācāryas,</i>
        or the heads of institutions propagating the Caitanya cult, and for all
        actual devotees. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to maintain the highest
        standard. (3) Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed that a pure devotee
        should be simple and free from sinful activities, for thus one can be
        His bona fide servant. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught His followers how
        to observe the renounced order strictly. (4) Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu
        wanted to prove that His devotees are exalted and that their character
        is ideal. He kindly accepts His faithful devotees and teaches them how
        much tribulation and disturbance can be produced by even a slight
        deviation from the strict principles of devotional life. (5) By
        chastising Junior Haridāsa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His mercy
        toward him, thus showing how elevated was Junior Haridāsa’s devotion for
        Him. Because of this transcendental relationship, the Lord corrected
        even a slight offense committed by His pure devotee. Therefore one who
        wants to be a pure devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu should give up all
        material sense gratification; otherwise, the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya
        Mahāprabhu are very difficult to attain. (6) If one dies in such a
        celebrated holy place as Prayāga, Mathurā or Vṛndāvana, one can be
        relieved of the reactions to sinful life and then attain the shelter of
        the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (7) Although a pure or faithful
        devotee may fall down, he nevertheless ultimately gets the chance to go
        back home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord.
