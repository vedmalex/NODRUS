        Here
        <i>rāḍha-deśe</i>
        refers to the village of the name Ekacakrā, in the district of Birbhum,
        next to Burdwan. After the Burdwan railway station there is another
        branch line, which is called the Loop Line of the Eastern Railway, and
        there is a railway station of the name Mallārapura. Eight miles east of
        this railway station, Ekacakrā village is still situated. Ekacakrā
        village extends north and south for an area of about eight miles. Other
        villages, namely Vīracandra-pura and Vīrabhadra-pura, are situated
        within the area of the village of Ekacakrā. In honor of the holy name of
        Vīrabhadra Gosvāmī, these places are renowned as Vīracandra-pura and
        Vīrabhadra-pura.

        In the Bengali year 1331 (A.D. 1924) a thunderbolt struck the temple of
        Ekacakrā-grāma. Therefore the temple is now in a broken state. Before
        this, there were no such accidents in that quarter. Within the temple
        there is a Deity of Śrī Kṛṣṇa established by Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. The
        name of the Deity is Baṅkima Rāya or Bāṅkā Rāya.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="bb1086678" class="r r-lang-ru r-paragraph">
      <p>
        On Baṅkima Rāya’s right side is a deity of Jāhnavā, and on His left side
        is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. The priests of the temple describe that Lord
        Nityānanda Prabhu entered within the body of Baṅkima Rāya and that the
        deity of Jāhnavā-mātā was therefore later placed on the right side of
        Baṅkima Rāya. Afterwards, many other Deities were installed within the
        temple. On another throne within the temple are Deities of Muralīdhara
        and Rādhā-Mādhava. On another throne are Deities of Manomohana,
        Vṛndāvana-candra and Gaura-Nitāi. But Baṅkima Rāya is the Deity
        originally installed by Nityānanda Prabhu.

        On the eastern side of the temple is a
        <i>ghāṭa</i>
        known as Kadamba-khaṇḍī on the bank of a river called the Yamunā, and it
        is said that the Deity of Baṅkima Rāya was floating in the water and
        Lord Nityānanda Prabhu picked Him up and then installed Him in the
        temple. Thereafter, in a place known as Bhaḍḍāpura, in the village of
        Vīracandra-pura, about half a mile west, in a place underneath a
        <i>nima</i>
        tree, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was found. For this reason, the Rādhārāṇī of
        Baṅkima Rāya was known as Bhaḍḍāpurera Ṭhākurāṇī, the mistress of
        Bhaḍḍāpura. On another throne, on the right side of Baṅkima Rāya, is a
        Deity of Yogamāyā.

        Now the temple and temple corridor rest on a high plinth, and on a
        concrete structure in front of the temple is a
        <i>kīrtana</i>
        hall. It is also said that on the northern side of the temple there was
        a Deity of Lord Śiva named Bhāṇḍīśvara and that the father of Nityānanda
        Prabhu, Hāḍāi Paṇḍita, used to worship that Deity. At present, however,
        the Bhāṇḍīśvara Deity is missing, and in his place a Jagannātha Svāmī
        Deity has been installed. Lord Nityānanda Prabhu did not factually
        construct any temples. The temple was constructed at the time of
        Vīrabhadra Prabhu. In the Bengali year 1298 (A.D. 1891), a
        <i>brahmacārī</i>
        of the name Śivānanda Svāmī repaired the temple, for it had become
        dilapidated.

        In this temple there is an arrangement to offer food to the Deity on the
        basis of seventeen seers (about thirty-four pounds) of rice and
        necessary vegetables. The present priestly order of the temple belongs
        to the family of Gopījana-vallabhānanda, one of the branches of
        Nityānanda Prabhu. There is a land settlement in the name of the temple,
        and income from this land finances the expenditures for the temple.
        There are three parties of priestly
        <i>gosvāmīs</i>
        who take charge of the temple management, one after another. A few steps
        from the temple is a place known as Viśrāmatalā, where it is said that
        Nityānanda Prabhu in His childhood used to enjoy sporting with His
        boyfriends by enacting the
        <i>rāsa-līlā</i>
        and various other pastimes of Vṛndāvana.

        Near the temple is a place named Āmalītalā (Imlitala), which is so named
        because of a big tamarind tree there. According to a party named the
        Neḍādi-sampradāya, Vīrabhadra Prabhu, with the assistance of twelve
        hundred Neḍās (Buddhist monks), dug a great lake of the name Śvetagaṅgā.
        Outside of the temple are tombs of the Gosvāmīs, and there is a small
        river known as the Mauḍeśvara, which is called the water of Yamunā.
        Within half a mile from this small river is the birthplace of Śrī
        Nityānanda Prabhu. It appears that there was a big
        <i>kīrtana</i>
        hall in front of the temple, but later it became dilapidated. It is now
        covered by banyan trees. Later on, a temple was constructed within which
        Gaura-Nityānanda Deities are existing. The temple was constructed by the
        late Prasannakumāra Kārapharmā. A tablet was installed in his memory in
        the Bengali year 1323 (A.D. 1916), in the month of Vaiśākha (April-May).

        The place where Nityānanda Prabhu appeared is called Garbhavāsa. There
        is an allotment of about forty-three
        <i>bighās</i>
        (fourteen acres) of land to continue the worship in a temple there. The
        Mahārāja of Dinājapura donated twenty
        <i>bighās</i>
        of land (about six and a half acres) in this connection. It is said that
        near the place known as Garbhavāsa, Hāḍāi Paṇḍita conducted a primary
        school. The priests of this place, listed in a genealogical table, were
        as follows: (1) Śrī Rāghavacandra, (2) Jagadānanda dāsa, (3) Kṛṣṇadāsa,
        (4) Nityānanda dāsa, (5) Rāmadāsa, (6) Vrajamohana dāsa, (7) Kānāi dāsa,
        (8) Gauradāsa, (9) Śivānanda dāsa and (10) Haridāsa. Kṛṣṇadāsa belonged
        to the Ciḍiyā-kuñja at Vṛndāvana. The date of his disappearance is
        Kṛṣṇa-janmāṣṭamī. Ciḍiyā-kuñja is a place now managed by the
        <i>gosvāmīs</i>
        of Śṛṅgāra-ghāṭa in Vṛndāvana. They are also known as belonging to the
        Nityānanda family, most probably on the basis of their relationship with
        Kṛṣṇadāsa.

        Near Garbhavāsa is a place called Bakulatalā, where Śrī Nityānanda
        Prabhu and His boyfriends used to take part in sporting activities known
        as
        <i>jhāla-jhapeṭā</i>.
        There is a
        <i>bakula</i>
        tree there that is wonderful because all its branches and subbranches
        look like the hoods of serpents. It has been suggested that by the
        desire of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Anantadeva manifested Himself in that
        way. The tree is very old. It is said that formerly it had two trunks,
        but later on, when the playmates of Nityānanda Prabhu felt inconvenience
        in jumping from the branches of one trunk to those of the other,
        Nityānanda Prabhu, by His mercy, merged the two trunks into one.

        Another place nearby is named Hāṅṭugāḍā. It is said that Lord Nityānanda
        Prabhu brought all the holy places there. Therefore the people in the
        surrounding villages go there instead of to the Ganges to take bath. It
        is named Hāṅṭugāḍā because Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu used to perform the
        <i>dadhi-ciḍā</i>
        festival of distributing chipped rice with yogurt
        <i>prasādam</i>
        there and He took the
        <i>prasādam</i>
        kneeling down. A sanctified lake in this place is always full of water
        throughout the year. A great fair is held there during Goṣṭhāṣṭamī, and
        there is another big fair on the birthday of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. In
        the
        <i>Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā</i>
        (58-63) it is described that Halāyudha, Baladeva, Viśvarūpa and
        Saṅkarṣaṇa appeared as Nityānanda Avadhūta.
