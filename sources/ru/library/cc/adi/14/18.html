        It is a Vedic principle to observe a festival in connection with
        Nārāyaṇa and
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>.
        Giving a child a particular name is among the purificatory processes
        known as
        <i>daśa-vidha-saṁskāra</i>,
        and on the day of such a ceremony one should observe a festival by
        worshiping Nārāyaṇa and distributing
        <i>prasādam</i>,
        chiefly among the
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>.
      </p>
    </div>

        When Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, Śacīmātā and Jagannātha Miśra understood from
        the marks on the Lord’s lotus feet that child Nimāi was not an ordinary
        child but an incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, they decided that on that very
        same day, which was very auspicious, they should observe a festival for
        His name-giving ceremony. In this connection we can particularly see how
        an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ascertained by
        His bodily symptoms, His activities and the prediction of the
        <i>śāstras</i>.
        By factual evidence a person can be accepted as an incarnation of God,
        not whimsically or by the votes of rascals and fools. There have been
        many imitation incarnations in Bengal since the appearance of Lord
        Caitanya, but any impartial devotee or learned man can understand that
        Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was accepted as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa not on
        the basis of popular votes but by evidence from the
        <i>śāstras</i>
        and bona fide scholars. It was not ordinary men who accepted Śrī
        Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the
        beginning His identity was ascertained by learned scholars like
        Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, and later all His activities were confirmed by the
        six Gosvāmīs, especially Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, and
        many other learned scholars, with evidence from the
        <i>śāstra</i>.
        An incarnation of God is such from the very beginning of His life. It is
        not that by performing meditation one can become an incarnation of God
        all of a sudden. Such false incarnations are meant for fools and
        rascals, not sane men.
