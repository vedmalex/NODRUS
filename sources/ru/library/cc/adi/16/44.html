        In this connection,
        <i>śruti-dhara</i>
        is a very important word.
        <i>Śruti</i>
        means “hearing,” and
        <i>dhara</i>
        means “one who can capture.” Formerly, before the beginning of
        Kali-yuga, almost everyone, especially among the intelligent men, the
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        , was a
        <i>śruti-dhara</i>
        . As soon as a student heard any of the Vedic wisdom from his master, he
        would remember it forever. There was no need to refer to books, and
        therefore there were no written books in those days. The spiritual
        master delivered the Vedic hymns and their explanations to the student,
        who would then remember them forever, without consulting books.

        To become a
        <i>śruti-dhara</i>
        , one who can remember simply by hearing, is a great achievement for a
        student. In the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (10.41) the Lord says:

        As soon as we find anything extraordinary, we should understand that
        such an extraordinary manifestation is the special grace of the Supreme
        Personality of Godhead. Therefore Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied to
        the champion, Keśava Kāśmīrī, that just as he was greatly proud of being
        a favorite devotee of mother Sarasvatī, so someone else, like Caitanya
        Mahāprabhu Himself, being favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
        could become a
        <i>śruti-dhara</i>
        and thus memorize anything immediately simply by hearing it.
