      <p>
        In the verse beginning with
        <i>mahattvaṁ gaṅgāyāḥ</i>
        there are five literary ornaments and five examples of faulty
        composition. There are two examples of the fault called
        <i>avimṛṣṭa-vidheyāṁśa</i>
        and one example each of the faults
        <i>viruddha-mati, punar-ukti</i>
        and
        <i>bhagna-krama</i>
        .
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="bb1087612" class="r r-lang-ru r-paragraph">
      <p>
        <i>Vimṛṣṭa</i>
        means “clean,” and
        <i>vidheyāṁśa</i>
        means “predicate.” It is a general rule of composition to establish a
        subject first and then give its predicate. For example, according to
        Sanskrit grammar if one says, “This man is learned,” his composition is
        in order. But if one says, “Learned is this man,” the composition is not
        in order. Such a flaw is called
        <i>avimṛṣṭa-vidheyāṁśa-doṣa</i>
        , or the fault of unclean composition. The subject matter to be known of
        the verse is the glorification of the Ganges, and therefore the word
        <i>idam</i>
        (“this”), or what is known, should have been placed before instead of
        after the glorification. The subject matter already known should be
        placed before the unknown so that its meaning will not be misconstrued.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="bb1087613" class="r r-lang-ru r-paragraph">
      <p>
        The second instance of
        <i>avimṛṣṭa-vidheyāṁśa-doṣa</i>
        occurs in the words
        <i>dvitīya-śrī-lakṣmīr iva</i>
        . In this composition the word
        <i>dvitīya</i>
        (“second”) is
        <i>vidheya</i>
        , or unknown. Placing the unknown first to make the compound word
        <i>dvitīya-śrī-lakṣmīr</i>
        is another fault. The words
        <i>dvitīya-śrī-lakṣmīr iva</i>
        were intended to compare the Ganges to the goddess of fortune, but
        because of this fault the meaning of the compound word was bewildering.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="bb1087614" class="r r-lang-ru r-paragraph">
      <p>
        The third fault is that of
        <i>viruddha-mati</i>
        , or contradictory conception, in the words
        <i>bhavānī-bhartuḥ</i>
        . The word
        <i>bhavānī</i>
        refers to the wife of Bhava, Lord Śiva. But since Bhavānī is already
        known as the wife of Lord Śiva, to add the word
        <i>bhartā</i>
        , “husband,” thus forming a compound meaning “the husband of the wife of
        Lord Śiva,” is contradictory, for thus it appears as if the wife of Lord
        Śiva had another husband.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="bb1087615" class="r r-lang-ru r-paragraph">
      <p>
        The fourth fault is
        <i>punar-ukti</i>
        , or redundancy, which occurs when the verb
        <i>vibhavati</i>
        (“flourishes”), which should have ended the composition, is further
        qualified by the unnecessary adjective
        <i>adbhuta-guṇā</i>
        (“endowed with wonderful qualities”). The fifth fault is
        <i>bhagna-krama</i>
        , which means “broken order.” In the first, third and fourth lines there
        is
        <i>anuprāsa</i>
        , or alliteration, created by the sounds
        <i>ta, ra</i>
        and
        <i>bha</i>
        , but in the second line there is no such
        <i>anuprāsa</i>
        , and therefore the order is broken.
