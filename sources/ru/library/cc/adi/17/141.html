          The loud sound of the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra certainly made
          the Kazi very much afraid, and he hid himself within his room. Hearing
          the people thus protesting, murmuring in great anger, the Kazi would
          not come out of his home.

        The Kazi’s order not to perform
        <i>saṅkīrtana</i>
        could stand only as long as there was no civil disobedience. Under the
        leadership of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the chanters,
        increasing in number, disobeyed the order of the Kazi. Thousands
        assembled together and formed parties, chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa
        <i>mahā-mantra</i>
        and making a tumultuous sound of protest. Thus the Kazi was very much
        afraid, as naturally one should be under such circumstances.

        In the present day also, people all over the world may join together in
        the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and protest against the present
        degraded governments of the world’s godless societies, which are based
        on all kinds of sinful activities.
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        states that in the Age of Kali, thieves, rogues and fourth-class people
        who have neither education nor culture capture the seats of governments
        to exploit the citizens. This is a symptom of Kali-yuga that has already
        appeared. People cannot feel secure about their lives and property, yet
        the so-called governments continue, and government ministers get fat
        salaries, although they are unable to do anything good for society. The
        only remedy for such conditions is to enhance the
        <i>saṅkīrtana</i>
        movement under the banner of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and protest against the
        sinful activities of all the world’s governments.

        The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not a sentimental religious
        movement; it is a movement for the reformation of all the anomalies of
        human society. If people take to it seriously, discharging this duty
        scientifically, as ordered by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the world will
        see peace and prosperity instead of being confused and hopeless under
        useless governments. There are always rogues and thieves in human
        society, and as soon as a weak government is unable to execute its
        duties, these rogues and thieves come out to do their business. Thus the
        entire society becomes a hell unfit for gentlemen to live in. There is
        an immediate need for a good government — a government by the people,
        with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unless the masses of people become Kṛṣṇa
        conscious, they cannot be good men. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement
        that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa
        <i>mahā-mantra</i>
        still has its potency. Therefore people should understand it seriously
        and scientifically and spread it all over the world.

        The
        <i>saṅkīrtana</i>
        movement started by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is described in the
        <i>Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa</i>,
        twenty-third chapter, beginning with verse 241, which states, “My dear
        Lord, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus feet.” Following Lord
        Caitanya’s chanting, all the devotees reproduced the same sound He
        chanted. In this way the Lord proceeded, leading the entire party on the
        strand roads by the bank of the Ganges. When the Lord came to His own
        <i>ghāṭa</i>,
        or bathing place, He danced more and more. Then He proceeded to Mādhāi’s
        <i>ghāṭa</i>.
        In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Supreme Lord, who was known as
        Viśvambhara, danced all over the banks of the Ganges. Then He proceeded
        to Bārakoṇā-ghāṭa, then Nāgariyā-ghāṭa, and, traveling through
        Gaṅgānagara, reached Simuliyā, a quarter at one end of the town. All
        these places surround Śrī Māyāpur. After reaching Simuliyā, the Lord
        proceeded toward the Kazi’s house, and in this way He reached the door
        of Chand Kazi.
