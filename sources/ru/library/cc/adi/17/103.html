          On another day an astrologer came who was said to know everything —
          past, present and future. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu received him
          with all honor and put this question before him.

        <i>Brāhmaṇas</i>
        generally used to become astrologers, Āyur-vedic physicians, teachers
        and priests. Although highly learned and respectable, such
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        went from door to door to distribute their knowledge. A
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        would first go to a householder’s home to give information about the
        functions to be performed on a particular
        <i>tithi</i>,
        or date, but if there were sickness in the family, the family members
        would consult the
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        as a physician, and the
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        would give instruction and some medicine. Often, since the
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        were expert in astrology, people would also be greatly inquisitive about
        their past, present and future.

        Although the
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        appeared at Lord Caitanya’s house as a beggar, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu
        received him with great respect because he was a qualified
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        who knew the astrological science perfectly. Although
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        would go door to door just like beggars, they were honored as very
        respectable guests. This was the system in Hindu society five hundred
        years ago, during the time of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This system was
        current even one hundred years ago; even fifty or sixty years ago, when
        we were children, such
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        would visit householders like humble beggars, and people would derive
        great benefit from the mercy of such
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>.
        The greatest benefit was that a householder could save a great deal of
        money from being spent on doctor bills because the
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>,
        aside from explaining the past, present and future, could ordinarily
        cure all kinds of diseases simply by giving instructions and some
        medicine. Thus no one was bereft of the benefit of a first-class
        physician, astrologer and priest. The important members of ISKCON should
        give careful attention to our Dallas school, where children are being
        taught Sanskrit and English to become perfect
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>.
        If they are actually trained as perfect
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>,
        they can save society from rogues and ruffians; indeed, people can live
        happily under the protection of qualified
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>.
        Therefore the
        <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i>
        (4.13) gives special stress to the division of society (
        <i>cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karmavibhāgaśaḥ</i>
        )
        <i></i>.
        Unfortunately some people are now claiming to be
        <i>brāhmaṇas</i>
        simply by birthright, with no qualifications. Therefore the entire
        society is in chaos.
