          Because of the resounding vibrations of the denizens of heaven singing

        In the higher planetary systems, there are not only different types of
        human beings, but also animals like lions and elephants. There are
        trees, and the land is made of emeralds. Such is the creation of the
        Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung in
        this regard,
        <i>keśava! tuyā jagata vicitra</i>
        : “My Lord Keśava, Your creation is colorful and full of varieties.”
        Geologists, botanists and other so-called scientists speculate about
        other planetary systems, but being unable to estimate the varieties on
        other planets, they falsely imagine that all planets but this one are
        vacant, uninhabited, and full of dust. Although they cannot even
        estimate the varieties existing throughout the universe, they are very
        proud of their knowledge, and they are accepted as learned by persons of
        a similar caliber. As described in
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        (2.3.19),
        <i>śva-vid-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</i>
        : materialistic leaders are praised by dogs, hogs, camels and asses, and
        they themselves are also big animals. One should not be satisfied with
        the knowledge imparted by a big animal. Rather, one must take knowledge
        from a perfect person like Śukadeva Gosvāmī.
        <i>Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</i>
        : our duty is to follow the instructions of the
        <i>mahājanas</i>
        . There are twelve
        <i>mahājanas</i>
        , and Śukadeva Gosvāmī is one of them.
