        It is sometimes said that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu disapproved of the
        acceptance of the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        order in this Kali-yuga because in the
        <i>śāstra</i>
        it is said:
      </p>

        “In this Age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse
        in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the
        order of
        <i>sannyāsa,</i>
        the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man’s
        begetting children in his brother’s wife.” (
        <i>Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa, Kṛṣṇa-janma-khaṇḍa</i>
        185.180)

        Nevertheless, we see that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself accepted
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        and approved of the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        of His elder brother, Viśvarūpa. It is clearly said here,
        <i>
          bhāla haila, — viśvarūpa sannyāsa karila/ pitṛ-kula, mātṛ-kula, — dui
          uddhārila.
        </i>
        Therefore, should it be thought that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu made
        statements that are contradictory? No, actually He did not. It is
        recommended that one accept
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        to dedicate his life for the service of the Lord, and everyone must take
        that kind of
        <i>sannyāsa,</i>
        for by accepting such
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        one renders the best service to both his paternal and maternal families.
        But one should not accept the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        order of the Māyāvāda school, which has practically no meaning. We find
        many Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>
        simply loitering in the street thinking themselves Brahman or Nārāyaṇa
        and spending all day and night begging so they can fill their hungry
        bellies. Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>
        have become so degraded that there is a section of them who eat
        everything, just like hogs and dogs. It is such degraded
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        that is prohibited in this age. Actually, Śrīla Śaṅkarācārya’s
        principles for the acceptance of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        were very strict, but later the so-called Māyāvādī
        <i>sannyāsīs</i>
        became degraded because of their false philosophy, which propounds that
        by accepting
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        one becomes Nārāyaṇa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected that kind of
        <i>sannyāsa.</i>
        But the acceptance of
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        is one of the items of the
        <i>varṇāśrama-dharma.</i>
        How then can it be rejected?
