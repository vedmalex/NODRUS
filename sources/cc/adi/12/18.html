        Of the six sons of Advaita Ācārya, three, Acyutānanda, Kṛṣṇa Miśra and
        Gopāla dāsa, lived faithfully in the service of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
        Since Acyutānanda did not accept a wife, he had no issue. The second son
        of Advaita Ācārya, Kṛṣṇa Miśra, had two sons, Raghunātha Cakravartī and
        Dola-govinda. The descendants of Raghunātha still live in Śāntipura, in
        the neighborhoods of Madana-gopāla-pāḍa, Gaṇakara, Mṛjāpura and
        Kumārakhāli. Dola-govinda had three sons, namely Cāṅda, Kandarpa and
        Gopīnātha. The descendants of Kandarpa live in Maldah, in the village
        Jikābāḍī. Gopīnātha had three sons, Śrīvallabha, Prāṇavallabha and
        Keśava. The descendants of Śrīvallabha live in the villages known as
        Maśiyāḍārā (Mahiṣaḍerā), Dāmukadiyā and Caṇḍīpura. There is a
        genealogical table for the family of Śrīvallabha beginning from his
        eldest son, Gaṅgā-nārāyaṇa. The descendants of Śrīvallabha’s youngest
        son, Rāmagopāla, still live in Dāmukadiyā, Caṇḍīpura, Śolamāri, and so
        on. The descendants of Prāṇavallabha and Keśava live in Uthalī. The son
        of Prāṇavallabha was Ratneśvara, and his son was Kṛṣṇarāma, whose
        youngest son was Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa. His son was Navakiśora, and
        Navakiśora’s second son was Rāmamohana, whose eldest son was Jagabandhu
        and whose third son, Vīracandra, accepted the
        <i>sannyāsa</i>
        order and established a Deity of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in Katwa.
        These two sons of Rāmamohana were known as Baḍa Prabhu and Choṭa Prabhu,
        and they inaugurated the circumambulation of Navadvīpa-dhāma. One may
        refer to the
        <i>Vaiṣṇava-mañjuṣā</i>
        for the complete genealogical table of Advaita Prabhu in the line of
        Kṛṣṇa Miśra.
