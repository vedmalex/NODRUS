        “It is
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam’s</i>
        opinion that the process of Deity worship is not actually necessary,
        just as the specific prescriptions of the
        <i>Pañcarātra</i>
        and other scriptures do not have to be followed. The
        <i>Bhāgavatam</i>
        enjoins that even without practicing Deity worship one can achieve the
        complete success of human life by any of the other devotional processes,
        such as simply offering oneself at the Lord’s feet for His protection.
        Nonetheless, Vaiṣṇavas following the path of Śrī Nārada and his
        successors endeavor to establish a personal relationship with the Lord
        by receiving the grace of a bona fide spiritual master through
        initiation, and in this tradition the devotees are obliged at the time
        of initiation to begin engaging in Deity worship.

        agitated. Therefore, to rectify this material conditioning the great

        In other words, the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa
        <i>mahā-mantra</i>
        is so powerful that it does not depend on official initiation, but if
        one is initiated and engages in
        <i>pañcarātra-vidhi</i>
        (Deity worship), his Kṛṣṇa consciousness will awaken very soon, and his
        identification with the material world will be vanquished. The more one
        is freed from material identification, the more one can realize that the
        spirit soul is qualitatively as good as the Supreme Soul. At such a
        time, when one is situated on the absolute platform, one can understand
        that the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical. At
        that stage of realization, the holy name of the Lord, the Hare Kṛṣṇa
        <i>mantra,</i>
        cannot be identified with any material sound. If one accepts the Hare
        Kṛṣṇa
        <i>mahā-mantra</i>
        as a material vibration, he falls down. One should worship and chant the
        holy name of the Lord by accepting it as the Lord Himself. One should
        therefore be initiated properly according to revealed scriptures under
        the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. Although chanting the
        holy name is good for both the conditioned and liberated soul, it is
        especially beneficial to the conditioned soul because by chanting it one
        is liberated. When a person who chants the holy name is liberated, he
        attains the ultimate perfection by returning home, back to Godhead. In
        the words of
        <i>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>

        material existence. Indeed, simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa

        The offenseless chanting of the holy name does not depend on the
        initiation process. Although initiation may depend on
        <i>puraścaryā</i>
        or
        <i>puraścaraṇa,</i>
        the actual chanting of the holy name does not depend on
        <i>puraścaryā-vidhi,</i>
        or the regulative principles. If one chants the holy name even once
        without committing an offense, he attains all success. During the
        chanting of the holy name, the tongue must work. Simply by chanting the
        holy name, one is immediately delivered. The tongue is
        <i>sevonmukha-jihvā</i>
        — it is controlled by service. One whose tongue is engaged in tasting
        material things and also talking about them cannot use the tongue for
        absolute realization.
