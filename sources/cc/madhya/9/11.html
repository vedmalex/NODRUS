          At the time, all the South Indian Vaiṣṇavas were worshipers of Lord
          Rāmacandra. Some were Tattvavādīs, and some were followers of
          Rāmānujācārya.

        Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura points out that the word
        “Tattvavādī” refers to the followers of Śrīla Madhvācārya. To
        distinguish his disciplic succession from the Māyāvādī followers of
        Śaṅkarācārya, Śrīla Madhvācārya named his party the Tattvavādīs.
        Impersonal monists are always attacked by these Tattvavādīs, who attempt
        to defeat their philosophy of impersonalism. Generally, they establish
        the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually the
        disciplic succession of Madhvācārya is known as the Brahmā Vaiṣṇava
        sect; that is the sect coming down from Lord Brahmā. Consequently the
        Tattvavādīs, or followers of Madhvācārya, do not accept the incident of
        Lord Brahmā’s illusion, which is recorded in the Tenth Canto of
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</i>
        Śrīla Madhvācārya has purposefully avoided commenting on that portion of
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        in which
        <i>brahma-mohana,</i>
        the illusion of Lord Brahmā, is mentioned. Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī was
        one of the
        <i>ācāryas</i>
        in the Tattvavāda disciplic succession, and he established the ultimate
        goal of transcendentalism to be attainment of pure devotional service,
        love of Godhead. Those Vaiṣṇavas belonging to the Gauḍīya-sampradāya,
        the disciplic succession following Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, are distinct
        from the Tattvavādīs, although they belong to the same
        Tattvavāda-sampradāya
        <i>.</i>
        The followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are therefore known as the
        Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya.

        The word
        <i>pāṣaṇḍī</i>
        refers to those who are opposed to pure devotional service. In
        particular, these are the Māyāvādīs, the impersonalists. A definition of
        <i>pāṣaṇḍī</i>
        is given in the
        <i>Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</i>
        (1.73), wherein it is stated:

        A
        <i>pāṣaṇḍī</i>
        is one who thinks that the Supreme Lord Nārāyaṇa, the Personality of
        Godhead, is on the same level with the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmā
        and Lord Śiva. A devotee never considers Lord Nārāyaṇa to be on the same
        platform with Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva. The Madhvācārya-sampradāya and
        Rāmānuja-sampradāya are mainly worshipers of Lord Rāmacandra, although
        the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas are supposed to be worshipers of Lord Nārāyaṇa and
        Lakṣmī and the Tattvavādīs are supposed to be worshipers of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
        At present, in most of the monasteries belonging to the
        Madhva-sampradāya, Lord Rāmacandra is worshiped.

        In the book known as
        <i>Adhyātma-rāmāyaṇa,</i>
        there are statements in chapters twelve to fifteen about worshiping the
        Deities of Śrī Rāmacandra and Sītā. There it is stated that during Lord
        Rāmacandra’s time there was a
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        who took a vow to fast until he saw Lord Rāmacandra. Sometimes, due to
        business, Lord Rāmacandra was absent from His capital for a full week
        and could not be seen by the citizens during that time. Because of his
        vow, the
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        could not take even a drop of water during that week. Later, after eight
        or nine days, when the
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        could see Lord Rāmacandra personally, he would break his fast. Upon
        observing the
        <i>brāhmaṇa’s</i>
        rigid vow, Lord Śrī Rāmacandra ordered His younger brother Lakṣmaṇa to
        deliver a pair of Sītā-Rāma Deities to the
        <i>brāhmaṇa.</i>
        The
        <i>brāhmaṇa</i>
        received the Deities from Śrī Lakṣmaṇajī and worshiped Them faithfully
        as long as he lived. At the time of his death, he delivered the Deities
        to Śrī Hanumānjī, who, for many years, hung Them around his neck and
        served Them with all devotion. After many years, when Hanumānjī departed
        on the hill known as Gandha-mādana, he delivered the Deities to
        Bhīmasena, one of the Pāṇḍavas, and Bhīmasena brought Them to his
        palace, where he kept Them very carefully. The last king of the
        Pāṇḍavas, Kṣemakānta, worshiped the Deities in that palace. Later, the
        same Deities were kept in the custody of the kings of Orissa known as
        Gajapatis. One of the
        <i>ācāryas,</i>
        known as Narahari Tīrtha, who was in the disciplic succession of
        Madhvācārya, received these Deities from the King of Orissa.

        It may be noted that these particular Deities of Rāma and Sītā have been
        worshiped from the time of King Ikṣvāku. Indeed, They were worshiped by
        the royal princes even before the appearance of Lord Rāmacandra. Later,
        during Lord Rāmacandra’s presence, the Deities were worshiped by
        Lakṣmaṇa. It is said that just three months before his disappearance,
        Śrī Madhvācārya received these Deities and installed them in the Uḍupī
        temple. Since then the Deities have been worshiped by the
        Madhvācārya-sampradāya at that monastery. As far as the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas
        are concerned, beginning with Rāmānujācārya, they also worshiped Deities
        of Sītā-Rāma. Sītā-Rāma Deities are also being worshiped in Tirupati and
        other places. From the Śrī Rāmānuja-sampradāya there is another branch
        known as Rāmānandī or Rāmāt, and the followers of that branch also
        worship Deities of Sītā-Rāma very rigidly. The Rāmānuja-sampradāya
        Vaiṣṇavas prefer the worship of Lord Rāmacandra to that of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.
