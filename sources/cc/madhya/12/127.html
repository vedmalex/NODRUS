      <p>
        It is significant that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told Svarūpa Dāmodara
        Gosvāmī that the Bengali Vaiṣṇava was “your Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava.” This
        means that all Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas who are followers of the Caitanya cult
        are subordinate to Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. The
        <i>paramparā</i>
        system is very strictly observed by Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. Śrī Caitanya
        Mahāprabhu’s personal secretary was Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. The next
        group of devotees was the six Gosvāmīs, then Kavirāja Gosvāmī. It is
        necessary to observe the
        <i>paramparā</i>
        system of the Caitanya cult. There are many offenses one can commit
        while serving the Lord, and these are described in the
        <i>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</i>
        and other books. According to the rules and regulations, no one should
        accept obeisances in the temple of the Lord before the Deity. Nor is it
        proper for a devotee to offer obeisances and touch the feet of the
        spiritual master before the Deity. This is considered an offense. Śrī
        Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself was personally the Supreme Personality of
        Godhead; therefore it was not actually offensive to wash His lotus feet
        in the temple. However, because He was playing the part of an
        <i>ācārya,</i>
        the Lord considered Himself an ordinary human being. He also wanted to
        give instructions to ordinary human beings. The point is that even
        though one plays the part of a spiritual master, he should not accept
        obeisances or permit a disciple to wash his feet before the Deity. This
        is a matter of etiquette.
