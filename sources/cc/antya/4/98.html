        For a further explanation of the importance of Bhārata-bhūmi, one may
        refer to
        <i>Ādi-līlā</i>
        9.41 and also
        <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>
        5.19.19-27. The special feature of a birth in India is that a person
        born in India becomes automatically God conscious. In every part of
        India, and especially in the holy places of pilgrimage, even an ordinary
        uneducated man is inclined toward Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and as soon as he
        sees a Kṛṣṇa conscious person, he offers obeisances. India has many
        sacred rivers, such as the Ganges, Yamunā, Narmadā, Kāverī and Kṛṣṇā,
        and simply by bathing in these rivers people are liberated and become
        Kṛṣṇa conscious. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says:

        One who has taken birth in the land of Bhārata-bhūmi, India, should take
        full advantage of his birth. He should become completely well versed in
        the knowledge of the
        <i>Vedas</i>
        and spiritual culture and should distribute the experience of Kṛṣṇa
        consciousness all over the world. People all over the world are madly
        engaging in sense gratification and in this way spoiling their human
        lives, with the risk that in the next life they may become animals or
        less. Human society should be saved from such a risky civilization and
        the danger of animalism by awakening to God consciousness, Kṛṣṇa
        consciousness. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has been started for
        this purpose. Therefore unbiased men of the highest echelon should study
        the principles of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and fully cooperate
        with this movement to save human society.
